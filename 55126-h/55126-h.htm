<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">To</span> the meteorologist
I hope the following pages may prove not only of some interest, but
of practical value as a small step towards that greater exactness
of language which is essential before we can attempt to explain all
the details of cloud structure, or even interchange our ideas and
observations with adequate precision. The varieties depicted and
described have been selected from many hundreds, as those which seem to
me to show such differences of form as to imply distinct differences
in the conditions to which they are due. I have not attempted to deal
with the physical causes of condensation except in a general way,
being unwilling to introduce diagrams of isothermals and adiabatics
and such purely scientific methods into a work also intended for a
wider public. For those who wish to pursue this part of the subject
I have appended a list of papers from the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> <cite>Quarterly Journal of
the Royal Meteorological Society</cite> and other sources, which may
serve as references. I also hope that some more votaries of the science
may be induced to realize that meteorology does not consist solely of
the tabulation of long columns of records, but includes subjects for
investigation as much more beautiful as they are more difficult.</p>

<p>To the artist I trust they may also be of some use, by calling
attention to the variety and exquisite beauty of the sky. Nothing is
more extraordinary in art than the general negligence of cloud-forms.
Many of them are quite as worthy of careful drawing as the leaves of a
tree, the flowers of a field, the ripples on a stream, or the texture
of a carpet, or a marble pavement. Yet it is the common rule to find
pictures, which are otherwise marvellous examples of skill and care,
disfigured by impossible skies with vague, shapeless clouds, as untrue
to nature as it would be possible to make them. Grace of outline,
delicacy of detail and texture, richness of contrast, beauty of form
and light and colour, all are present in the skies, and combine to make
a whole well worthy of the best that art can give. The illustrations
I offer are not selected for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii"
id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span> pictorial effect; they are chosen from a
purely scientific point of view; but they are enough to indicate what
could be done if the facts of nature were treated with high artistic
skill.</p>

<p>In addition to the meteorologist and the artist, there are a much
larger number who follow neither profession, but who love Nature in
all her moods; and to them also I hope these pages may be of interest.
Indeed, if only a few of them should be stimulated to take up a branch
of nature study which has given me many an hour of quiet enjoyment, the
labour of bringing these notes together will not have been in vain.</p>

<p class="ph1">CLOUD STUDIES</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="chtitle">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> who have the
faculties proper to man must have been to some extent students of
cloud form. Go where we will, do what we will, we cannot easily escape
from the sky, or avoid noticing some of its features and coupling
them with the varying conditions of weather. We all sometimes want
to know if it is likely to rain, or whether some other change is
probable; and experience soon shows us that the clouds give the
simplest and most obvious indication of what we may expect. It is
almost impossible to avoid noticing that certain types of cloud,
or the simultaneous appearance of certain types, is the usual
accompaniment of definite kinds of weather or of particular changes.
Thus it is that most people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2"
id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> acquire some small measure of weather wisdom
before their schooldays are over.</p>

<p>Generation after generation, through all human history, the same
causes must have led to the same conclusions; and the study of clouds
must, therefore, be one of the oldest of all branches of scientific
inquiry. Yet, old as it is, it is still in its infancy, having
made very little advance indeed towards the precision of an exact
science.</p>

<p>There are many reasons for this want of growth, and so far as
the theoretical aspects of the subject are concerned it is easy
enough to understand. Clouds are among the most inaccessible of
terrestrial objects. Except by balloon ascents, by sending up kites
bearing recording instruments, or by making observations among the
mountain-tops, we have no means of getting at them to study the
conditions under which they exist. Temperature, pressure, humidity,
have generally to be guessed at, those guesses being based on the
scanty data which have been laboriously obtained by one or another
of these cumbrous methods. Moreover, many clouds have such vast
dimensions that it is very difficult to grasp all that goes on in such
a space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the difficulty of attacking the problems presented by cloud
formation, it is probable that even if we could have got among the
clouds at will, we should have understood little more than we do, from
a want of sufficient certainty on many of the purely physical questions
involved. It is not many years since Mr. J. Aitken discovered the
necessity for material nuclei as a first step in the formation of cloud
particles, and not many months have elapsed since Mr. C. T. R. Wilson
showed that those particles can be formed by the action of radiation
on the air itself. There is nothing surprising, therefore, in the fact
that our theoretical knowledge of the why and wherefore of the facts
revealed by a study of clouds is limited to general principles, and
quite fails to say exactly why each special form should be assumed. The
matter for surprise is quite different.</p>

<p>Theoretical explanations are not the first step in the working out
of a branch of science. It begins with the acquisition, by diligent and
painstaking observation, of a great mass of facts. This may go on for
centuries, the accumulation growing greater and greater, until at last
some one comes who examines the records, classifies them carefully,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
finally makes a summary in the form of a number of generalizations,
which are announced under the name of Laws.</p>

<p>Two examples of such &#8220;Laws&#8221; will suffice. Astronomers
for centuries had observed the movements of the planets, always
with increasing accuracy, until Tycho Brahe made his famous series
of observations on the planet Mars. These materials fell into the
hands of Kepler, and the result of his work was the announcement of
Kepler&#8217;s Laws, which state the rules which govern the movements
of the planets in their orbits. He found that the records could not be
accounted for unless the planets moved in a certain way, but he knew
nothing of the reasons for a method and order which clearly existed.</p>

<p>Kepler&#8217;s Laws, in fact, rest upon another set, namely,
Newton&#8217;s Laws of Gravitation, and these are themselves a second
example. They are the summary of accumulated experience, and even at
the present day we know nothing certain as to why two bodies should
attract each other, and nothing as to why that mutual attraction should
act as it was found to act by Newton.</p>

<p>The observational part of cloud study, however,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> is still in
its infancy, in spite of the fact that it has been going on for such
countless ages. We are still in the condition of the humble observers
engaged in the comparatively humdrum task of gathering facts for
future arrangement and interpretation. Cloud observers, in all ages,
have suffered from a peculiar difficulty. They have had no common
language, no code of signs by which they could benefit from the work
of those who had gone before them, no means of transmitting their own
experience to each other, or to those who would come after them. No
progress would be possible in any study under such conditions, for
each person would begin where the previous generation began, instead
of taking up the task where others had left it. In all languages there
is an extraordinary scarcity of cloud names, and such as do exist are
frequently applied to quite different forms by different people. So
pronounced is this lack of terms, that any one who tries to describe
a sky without using any of the modern scientific names, finds himself
obliged to rely on long detailed descriptions, backed with references
to well-known objects, whose outlines or structures resemble the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> clouds more
or less vaguely; and even then he has to be a word-painter of singular
skill if his description calls up in the mind of the reader a picture
much like the original.</p>

<p>It was to meet this want of a common tongue that Luke Howard, in
1803, proposed his scheme of cloud names. He recognized three main
types of cloud architecture, which he named Cirrus, Stratus, and
Cumulus. Cirrus included all forms which are built up of delicate
threads, like the fibres in a fragment of wool; Stratus was applied
to all clouds which lie in level sheets; and Cumulus was the lumpy
form.</p>

<p>By combinations of these terms other clouds were described. Thus,
a quantity of cirrus arranged in a sheet was called cirro-stratus,
while high, thin clouds like cirrus, but made up of detached rounded
balls, was cirro-cumulus. Many cumulus clouds, arranged in a sheet
with little space between them, became cumulo-stratus, while the great
clouds from which our heavy rains descend partake, to some extent,
of all three types, and were therefore distinguished by a special
name&mdash;Nimbus.</p>

<p>This system had much to recommend it. The<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> three fundamental types were
obvious to all. Their names were descriptive, and were derived from a
dead language, so that no living international jealousies were raised.
It was sufficiently detailed to serve the purposes of the time, when
accurate observation was in its infancy. Hence it was universally
adopted, and will pretty certainly hold its own as the broad basis upon
which any more detailed system must necessarily rest.</p>

<p>It has done excellent service; but although observation of clouds
in a general way is far from complete, attention is now being given to
much smaller details and much more minute differences of form, and our
vocabulary must be amplified. Precision of description is the first
essential of a satisfactory system, and the question is, what sort of
edifice can we build on Luke Howard&#8217;s foundation.</p>

<p>The great difficulty is the infinite variety of clouds. Certain
forms may be arbitrarily selected as types, and names may be given
to them; but however well they are chosen, a very short period of
observation will show that there are all manner of intermediate
forms, which make a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8"
id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> gradation from one type to another. This
fact should never be forgotten. There is always a danger that the
use of any system of names based on types shall lead to the neglect
of everything not typical. A curious illustration is afforded by the
well-known fact, that in arranging collections of fossil shells, it
is frequently found that some specimens do not exactly match the type
examples to which names have been assigned. In former days it was the
custom to throw aside such &#8220;bad specimens,&#8221; as they did not
show plainly the specific characters. It is now realized that they have
a value of their own, in that they are the links in the evolutionary
chain, once supposed to be missing. Indeed, it is not unfrequent
nowadays to see carefully selected series, showing the gradual change
whereby one species passed into another, displayed in the place of
honour, while the type specimens are relegated to humbler places in the
general collection.</p>

<p>Types there must be, no doubt, and where the series is continuous,
some one must make the selection. With clouds the series is absolutely
continuous. The task is like choosing typical links from a long chain
in which each link is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9"
id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> exactly like its neighbours, yet no two
are alike, and the greater the distance between them the less their
likeness. Clearly any system put forward must be accompanied by
illustrations, so that all may know exactly which links have been
chosen.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to meet the want; some of the systems
proposed being based on the forms assumed by the clouds, some on their
supposed mode of origin, and some on their altitudes. Those which
were not founded on Luke Howard&#8217;s types had no chance of being
accepted, while knowledge was not yet sufficiently far advanced to
make classifications based on origin of form at all possible. But the
great reason why none of the proposed schemes could come into general
use was that they were put forward without adequate illustration,
so that none but their authors knew exactly what they meant.<a
name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Matters came to a head in 1891, when an International Meteorological
Conference met at Munich. One object of this gathering was to promote
inquiries into the forms and motions of clouds, by means of concerted
observations at the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10"
id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> institutes and observatories of the globe.
Luke Howard&#8217;s system was not enough for the purpose in view, and
the addition of more detailed terms had to be settled before work could
be begun.</p>

<p>Professor Hildebrandsson, of Upsala, and the Hon. Ralph Abercromby
jointly submitted a revised scheme, the main feature of which was the
introduction of a new class of clouds, to be distinguished by the
prefix alto-before the other name. Such alto clouds were less lofty and
denser than cirrus. This scheme was the best before the Conference, and
without waiting to discuss, and possibly improve it, it was formally
adopted, and a committee appointed to arrange and publish an atlas
showing pictures of the type-forms. This atlas did not appear until
1896, and in the mean time the Rev. W. Clement Ley had published
proposals of his own, some of which had much to recommend them. But
he was too late. The International Committee had come to a decision,
and, although it may be far from ideal, the system backed by such an
authority must be regarded as the standard until some similar gathering
has given worldwide sanction to a change, and even then it would<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> be
better to modify by addition rather than by substitution.</p>

<p>The subjects of the following pages are named in general accordance
with this International Code, but they are by no means restricted to
types. Their object is not to attempt any repetition of the work which
has already been well done by the Atlas Committee, but rather to show
the chief varieties within a type. It will, however, become abundantly
evident that the standard system is far from complete, and that any
minute and detailed study of cloud-form must take note of the precise
variety.</p>

<p>This at once raises the question whether many of these varieties
are not sufficiently distinct to be given definite names. If a
meteorologist is told that cirrus clouds were seen on a particular
occasion, he instinctively asks&mdash;What sort of cirrus? and is
utterly unable to form any mental picture of the clouds until the
question has been answered by a detailed description. A glance at a
few of the plates further on will show the difficulty plainly, and it
occurs with other forms of cloud as well as cirrus.</p>

<p>Is it not time that the International names were<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> regarded
as those of the cloud genera, and to add specific names for those
varieties which seem to imply some difference in kind in the conditions
which have led to their formation? This has been here attempted by
translating into Latin the ordinary English term by which the variety
would naturally be described. More extended observation will probably
show that other species should be introduced, and possibly some of
those suggested in these pages may have to be subdivided. Whatever
the names may be, specific distinction of some sort is an essential
preliminary to detailed study of the why and wherefore of the
particular forms.</p>

<p>The International system is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. Upper clouds.</p>

<p class="inset">
(<i>a</i>) Cirrus.<br />
(<i>b</i>) Cirro-stratus.</p>

<p>B. Intermediate clouds.</p>

<p class="inset">
(<i>a</i>) Cirro-cumulus and alto-cumulus.<br />
(<i>b</i>) Alto-stratus.</p>

<p>C. Lower clouds.</p>

<p class="inset">
(<i>a</i>) Strato-cumulus.<br />
(<i>b</i>) Nimbus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>D. Clouds of diurnal ascending currents.</p>

<p class="inset">(<i>a</i>) Cumulus and cumulo-nimbus.</p>

<p>E. High fogs.</p>

<p class="inset">(<i>b</i>) Stratus.</p>

<p>In this tabulation the forms marked (<i>a</i>) are detached and occur in
dry weather, while those marked (<i>b</i>) are widely extended. The original
scheme also gives the mean heights of the various types, but these
values have been omitted here because they are extremely variable,
and impossible to ascertain with any approach to accuracy by mere eye
estimates. They vary also with the season, and probably also with the
locality. Moreover, the altitude is no guide to the name, except that
on the whole the types occur in the order given, taking group A as the
highest and group E as the lowest. In the chapter on cloud altitudes
this subject will be further considered, and under the descriptions
of cloud-forms their average height or actual measurements for the
particular specimen figured will be given whenever possible.</p>

<p>Before coming to the description of individual forms, it may
not be out of place to give brief consideration to the best means
of observing them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14"
id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> nature. For eye observation, of course,
no directions are needed when we are dealing with the lower and denser
varieties; but when we come to the highest groups it sometimes becomes
necessary to protect the eye from the brilliant glare which may make it
impossible to detect the real structure. Smoked glass, neutral-tinted
spectacles, or yellow glass all have something to recommend them;
but by far the most convenient means is to look, not at the clouds
themselves, but at their images formed in a black mirror. A lantern
cover glass, or a thin piece of plate-glass, blacked on the back with
some black paint, serves admirably. But all black paints are not
equally good. The best are oil paints which dry with a glossy surface,
the so-called enamels. They have the advantage that the varnish with
which they are mixed has an index of refraction not very different from
that of the glass. The consequence is that so little light is reflected
from the blackened back, compared with that which is reflected from the
front surface of the glass, that the second image can only be detected
with difficulty. If the mirror is a piece of black or deeply coloured
glass all trace of the second image is lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15"
id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>With this simple appliance it is easy to study the details of the
thinnest clouds right up to the sun, and even the image of the sun
itself may be glanced at without serious discomfort. Nor is the general
diminution of brightness the only gain. If the glass is so held that
the light from the cloud makes an angle of about 33 degrees with the
surface, some of the blue light from the sky is suppressed altogether,
while that from the cloud is practically unaffected. The exact fraction
suppressed depends upon the part of the sky relative to the sun, and
also on the position of the mirror, but a few minutes&#8217; trial will
show when the maximum effect has been reached.</p>

<p>It is astonishing to see for the first time how the delicate
filaments of cirrus or the beautiful structures of cirro-cumulus stand
out shining white on the deep blue background; and the use of the black
mirror is a revelation to most. It also has one indirect advantage,
which is really more important than it seems. By gazing down into a
mirror long-continued observations can be made, and one form of cloud
may be watched changing into another, and possibly back again into its
original shape, without any danger of incurring that unpleasant result
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
much looking upwards which is sometimes known as exhibition headache.
Such a mirror may be quite small, so that it can be carried in a
pocket-book, a point of some moment, as many of the forms of cirrus are
exceedingly transient, coming and going in a few minutes, while others
are in a state of continuous change. This is particularly often the
case with the exquisite ripple clouds, and the delicate lacework of the
higher kinds of cirrus.</p>

<p>Still another advantage possessed by the mirror is that it makes
it easy to see the solar halos formed on the verge of a cyclone, and
to detect their iridescent colouring in a way which is quite beyond
the reach of the naked eye or any protective spectacles. Every one
is familiar with the faint halos formed round the moon, but the
corresponding solar phenomenon is comparatively little known, though it
is far commoner, much more brilliant, and often glows with colour. Its
very brightness, and that of the background on which it is projected,
hides it from the eye, except on those rare occasions when the sun is
conveniently hidden by some thicker cloud.</p>

<p>If some permanent record is desired, much can<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> be done
with a few light strokes of a pencil, but more ambitious pictures are
best secured by the use of soft pastels, aided by a liberal use of the
finger or leather stump. Ordinary paints, whether oil or water-colour,
are of little use for actual study of cloud detail, except in the hands
of a highly skilled artist who knows how to get the effect he wants in
the minimum of time.</p>

<p>But no sketching or drawing can make records of cirrus or alto
clouds with the speed and accuracy necessary for careful study.
Photography is really the only way in which the amazing wealth of
detail can be truthfully portrayed. Yet even the camera has its
limitations. It does not record colour, and completely fails to
delineate the forms of alto-stratus, stratus, or nimbus, if they are
present in the most typical condition, that is to say, when they cover
the whole sky with a uniform tint. It is only when these forms are more
or less broken up that a photograph, or anything other than a carefully

<p>Cloud photography, even of the most delicate and brilliant
varieties, is easy enough when the right methods are followed;
but these are not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18"
id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> same as those which are right for
portraiture or landscape work of the usual kind. The background of blue
sky produces almost the same effect on the plate as the image of the
cloud itself, and the whole art consists in an adequate exaggeration
of the minute difference so as to reveal the details of form and
structure.</p>

<p>A slow plate&mdash;the accompanying illustrations have
all been taken on Mawson and Swan&#8217;s photo-mechanical
plates&mdash;extremely cautious development, and sometimes
intensification of the image, are all that is necessary; but the
process becomes easier if, instead of pointing the camera to the cloud,
it is directed to the image formed in a properly constructed black
mirror. Many of the following studies have been taken by this method,
and details of the camera and processes employed will be found in a
later chapter, for the convenience of any one who may be inspired to
take up a fascinating branch of photography.</p>

<p>It has been said that reference will be made to the average
altitudes of the different types of cloud, and to the actual
altitude of some of the varieties shown. The question will, no
doubt, have occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19"
id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> to some as to how those altitudes have
been measured. The methods are all more or less complicated, involving
rather laborious calculation. They generally depend upon simultaneous
observations made from two stations at opposite ends of a measured
base line. Sometimes the observations are made directly by pointing
an instrument at each station to some agreed point of the cloud. It
is obvious that the two directions must converge to this point. If
the convergence is measured, the exact distance from either station
can be calculated, and if the angle between the cloud-point and the
horizon beneath it is noted, it is a simple matter to deduce the actual
altitude of the cloud. At other places the observers have relied
upon the comparison of photographs simultaneously taken from the two
stations. In this method it is necessary to know the exact direction
in which the camera is pointed, and the position of the image upon
the plate then gives the direction of the cloud as seen from that
particular station, and the subsequent calculations are the same.</p>

<p>Measurements by one or the other of the above methods have been made
at several places, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20"
id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> extensive series being those which
have been compiled at Upsala, and at the Blue Hill Observatory in
Massachusetts. The method employed by the writer at Exeter has
been rather different, and a description will be found later on in
the chapter on Cloud Altitudes, the fuller consideration of which
comes naturally after the different forms have been described and
compared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="chtitle">CIRRUS</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A cloud</span> is sometimes
defined as any visible mass composed of small particles of ice or
water suspended in the air, and formed by condensation from the state
of vapour. As a general rule this is exact enough, but under certain
circumstances it is possible to have the particles so small, and so
thinly scattered, that it is not fully satisfied. The resulting mass
may not be actually visible. The presence of the condensed particles
may be indicated by nothing more than a slight whitening of the blue
sky, or by the formation about the sun or moon of bright circles
of light known as halos. If such a halo appears, it is generally a
phenomenon of brief duration. Sometimes the circle breaks and becomes
incomplete by the passing away of the thin patch of cloud, sometimes
the cloud increases in density until the rings are destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22"
id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The thinnest variety of this halo-producing structure is quite
invisible to the eye. It is so thin as to have no distinctly noticeable
effect upon the colour of the sky, but the optical results of its
presence may be very remarkable. Highly complicated systems of rings
are sometimes produced, the rings, as a rule, falling into two groups.
The commonest form has the sun (or moon) in the centre, and a circle
of pale light at a distance of about 22 degrees. Larger rings are seen
less frequently, which have an angular radius of about 46 degrees,
and as a rule have the sun situated on the ring itself. In Plate <a
href="#Plate_1">1</a> we have a part of such a great halo. The camera
was directed towards the east, and tilted upwards at an angle of about
40 degrees. The sun was behind the camera, in the south-west, and the
ring could be traced right up to it on either side.</p>

<p>At the same time the sun was surrounded partially by a halo
of the more ordinary type, which was brightly coloured, making
an effective contrast to the dull white of the greater ring. The
phenomenon did not last more than half an hour, and the changes in its
appearance coincided with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23"
id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> growing density of cloud. When first
noticed the great ring was alone, and the sky was of a full blue, but a
silvery film came gradually up from the south-west, and the smaller and
brighter halo flashed out as the delicate curtain came near the sun.
Slowly the cloud spread to the north-east, gathering density from the
opposite point of the compass; and by the time the ordinary halo was at
its best, the great white ring had completely vanished.</p>

<p>These circles, and the bright spots called mock-suns or mock-moons
which often accompany them, can all be explained on the assumption
that their cause is the passage of light through a veil composed of
hexagonal crystals of ice. The simple halo of 22 degrees radius is
common in most parts of the world, being very generally formed by the
film of high cloud which marks the advancing edge of a cyclonic cloud
system. A portion of one is shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_2">2</a>,
in which the rudimentary fibrous structure of the sheet of cloud is
distinctly seen. Halos of this sort are frequently coloured, often
most brilliantly so; but the tints are seldom noticed unless a black
mirror is used. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24"
id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> sometimes quite as bright as those of an
ordinary rainbow, but instead of being projected upon a background of
dark rain-clouds, they are seen against a part of the sky which is near
the sun, and therefore exceptionally bright.</p>

<p>The red is always on the inside of the ring, the violet outside,
thereby distinguishing them at once from the so-called coron&aelig;,
which are formed around the sun or moon when shining through a sheet
of alto or other lower cloud made up of liquid particles. In these the
radius of the rings is much less, and the red is on the outside, the
violet actually touching the central luminary.</p>

<p>The cloud which produces halos is called cirro-nebula. It is much
thinner, and on an average higher than cirro-stratus. Mr. Ley named it
cirro-velum (or cirro-veil), but cirro-nebula has now got to be fairly
well understood. It sometimes appears and disappears in a curious
manner, showing that it occurs in patches, which drift about or which
keep forming and melting away, only to repeat the process. If, however,
it forms part of an advancing cyclone fringe, then the sky gets whiter
and whiter, until it is covered with a sheet of undoubted<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
cirro-stratus. This process of growing density is shown in progress in
Plate 3.</p>

    <p>CIRRO-NEBULA CHANGING TO CIRRO-STRATUS.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Cirro-nebula, as we shall call it, floats at very great altitudes in
temperate regions; but in polar latitudes, where the optical phenomena
peculiar to it are most brilliant and diversified, it seems probable
that the ice dust is much lower down, even in actual proximity to the
ground. In England its height varies greatly with the time of year, and
other circumstances, but mounts up in summer to such altitudes as nine
miles or more; the greatest height yet recorded being 9&middot;6 miles,
or about 15,500 metres, at Exeter.</p>

<p>The change from cirro-nebula to cirro-stratus is generally
accompanied by the formation of a distinct fibrous structure, easily
observable by the black mirror. This is not really a new feature, but
only a further development of a structure already existing, but too
minute to be easily seen. True halo-producing cirro-nebula may usually
be shown to possess more or less of a fibrous texture in an indirect
way, which is worth a brief description.</p>

<p>In order to observe the spots on the sun and other features
of the solar surface, it is a common practice to hold a white
screen, say, about a foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26"
id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> from the eyepiece of a telescope,
while the instrument is pointed to the sun. An image, considerably
magnified, is thus projected on to the screen, and the solar
details can be studied with ease and safety. If thin clouds drift
before the sun, their images are similarly projected as they
pass across its disc, and it is possible thus to detect not only
the fibrous texture but also the movement of cirro-nebula.<a
name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The change into cirro-stratus is also attended by a marked fall in
altitude, but whether this is due to an actual descent of the cloud
particles, or to a downward spread of the conditions which give rise
to them, cannot at present be definitely settled. The balance of
probability points very strongly towards the downward spread of the
conditions. It is likely that the clouds, particularly the cyclonic
specimens, are wedge-shaped, and that as they pass overhead we see
first the thin edge, and later on the thicker parts, which project
much lower down. This is just one of those many minor problems in
cloud mechanics which we are not able to solve from the scanty
data on record.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27"
id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p> <p>Occasionally cirro-nebula breaks
up into little detached semi-transparent cloudlets, all of them
exceedingly thin, and showing a complicated mottling, resembling, on
a minute scale, the ripple clouds of much lower altitudes. Such a sky
is depicted in Plate <a href="#Plate_4">4</a>, but no reproduction
can possibly do justice to the minute and delicate features of the
real thing. The arrangement of the faint markings was in a state of
continual flux, curiously similar to the ever-changing aspect of the
sun&#8217;s photosphere when seen under adequate power. Some parts of
the cloud stratum would at one moment break up into distinct granules
arranged in complicated patterns, other parts would assume a fibrous
texture, and yet other places would show a continuous smooth sheet. In
a minute or two all would be changed&mdash;the smooth part granulated,
the fibres vanished, and the granules fused together, and so on, no two
of a series of photographs representing the same details.</p>

</div>

<p>These changes of form continued until the whole was hidden from
view by a veil of much lower stratiform cloud, one advance portion of
which is shown. Plate <a href="#Plate_4">4</a> does not represent a
type or a distinct variety of cloud. It is an intermediate form, or
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
temporary condition, showing cirro-nebula in the act of changing into
cirro-cumulus, or possibly cirro-stratus.</p>

<p>Cirro-nebula itself, in its simpler form, is, however, a distinct
type. It is true that it never persists over one locality for more
than an hour or two without passing into some denser form, but while
it lasts its features are so distinctive, and the optical phenomena
to which it gives rise are so striking and significant, that it is a
matter for surprise that it should in the International system have
been relegated to the position of a subordinate variety of cirrus. It
is more nearly related to cirro-stratus, but is sufficiently distinct
from that to deserve at least specific rank.</p>

<p>True typical cirrus must have a plainly shown fibrous structure. The
fibres may cross and interlace, they may radiate in fan-like manner,
or they may curl and twist like a well-trimmed ostrich feather. The
clouds so formed must not be arranged in a continuous level sheet, or
they at once become cirro-stratus, and it is impossible to invent a
definition which will mark the exact limits of either type. Typical
cirrus consists of detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29"
id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> clouds. They cast no shadows on the
landscape, for the simple reasons that they are semi-transparent and
their component parts too narrow. If the sun is shining down obliquely
through the naked boughs of a tall tree, it will be seen that the
lowest twigs cast fairly sharp shadows on the ground, but that even
these are bordered by a fading rim; the twigs further up cast no sharp
shadows, but broader faint bands of shade; while the topmost boughs
cast no shadows which can clearly be identified. In other words, the
more distant the narrow twig is from the ground the narrower the real
shadow or umbra, and the broader the penumbra becomes, until when the
distance is sufficient the shadow is all penumbra. Cirrus filaments
throw nothing but a faint penumbra. Indeed, it is only when they lie in
the earth&#8217;s shadow, and stand against the background of a faintly
lighted sky, that they show any sign of shadow even on themselves.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that they are composed of particles of ice. They
are formed at altitudes where the thermometer must be many degrees
below freezing-point, and not a few of the thinner examples show
fragmentary halos like those of cirro-nebula.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30"
id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Their actual altitudes are very variable, being greater in summer
than in winter, and reaching a maximum for any given station after a
long spell of hot weather. Exact measurements have not yet been made
in tropical latitudes or in polar regions, but there is every reason
to expect that the upper limit of cirrus for equatorial districts will
be found to be much higher than in the temperate zones where actual
observations have been made. In places nearer to the Arctic Circle it
is also almost certain that the altitudes will be less.</p>

<p>In the New England states, as shown by the Blue Hill observations,
the maximum altitude for summer was found to be little under 15,000
metres. At Upsala, in Sweden, it was 13,300 metres. The average
altitudes at the same observatories were, respectively, about 9900 and
8800 metres. At Exeter the writer&#8217;s own measurements give an
average for the summer months of 10,200 metres, with a minimum rather
lower than was the case in America or Sweden, and with a maximum far
above the foreign values. In winter cirrus certainly comes much lower
down, but the number of observations is fewer.</p>

<p>The loftiest variety of cirrus appears in the afternoon in very hot
weather, sometimes quite late in the evening; and in autumn it is by no
means a rare event for it to suddenly form just when the sunset colours
are fading, or even after they have paled into twilight. Under such
circumstances it stands out of a shining silvery grey colour against
the background of the darkening sky. A specimen of it is shown in Plate
5, which shows its extreme slightness of form and delicacy of texture.
Sometimes it remains visible so long after the stars have begun to
show as to give the idea that it is self luminous, and the illusion
is certainly very strong. The writer has noted several instances in
which it was plainly visible, like a silvery curtain, though the sky
as a whole was so dark that stars like the five brightest points of
the Great Bear could be seen through the cloud, and much smaller
stars down to the third and fourth magnitude were plainly visible in
the clear intervals. It has sometimes been called luminous cloud,
and Mr. Ley estimated its altitude at upwards of 90,000 metres; but
if we think of it as reflecting the light of the distant colourless
twilight there is no need to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32"
id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> regard it as anything fundamentally
different from other clouds, or to assume a greater altitude than we
know to have been the case. The specimen figured occurred in the early
afternoon on June 12, 1899, at Exeter, and careful measurements of its
altitude were made. This worked out as 17&middot;02 miles, or more than
27,000 metres, a value so much greater than all other measurements of
the kind that it was only after most careful verification and reference
to duplicate records that it could be accepted. It differs in several
ways from the lower varieties, being thinner, more glistening, and in
every way more delicate. A suitable distinctive name would be high
cirrus, or cirrus excelsus.</p>

<p>Lower down by thousands of metres come the feathery masses of
typical windy cirrus, such as are shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_6">6</a>. Indeed, in cold
winter weather they occur within three or four thousand metres of the
ground. In the instance figured the wind was blowing from left to
right, and the clouds were travelling swiftly. The upper filaments
appeared to be repeatedly torn away from the main masses, while the
long faint streaks which trail below and behind are evidently due to
streams of fine particles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33"
id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> falling from the main centres of
condensation into a less rapidly moving stratum below. There is no
room for doubt that these clouds, like others of a similar order, are
formed by a direct passage from the vapour to the solid, or that the
fibres are made of minute snowflakes. The condensation is evidently
attended by rapid movements, which draw out the cloud, as fast as it is
formed, into long curving lines which mark lines of motion. The variety
is always, therefore, an indication of strong winds and rapid eddying
movements in the region in which it occurs. Such strong disturbances
overhead almost always accompany similar but less intense movements
at the ground-level, and when they do not accompany them they precede
them. The cloud is well named windy cirrus, which may be converted into
a specific name, cirrus ventosus.</p>

<p>The next variety we come to (Plate <a href="#Plate_7">7</a>) is in
some ways rather similar. It is, however, thinner, more delicate, and
is entirely composed of fine threads, which are more systematically
arranged. Generally there is a bundle, or several bundles, of long
parallel fibres, which form, so to say, the quill of the feather, with
numbers of shorter threads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34"
id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> branching out from them at various angles.
Cirrus ventosus was indicative of irregular movements in various
directions; this variety points also to complicated movements, but
executed in accordance with some sort of system, strangely complex
and wonderfully ordered. The specimen figured is the type of what Mr.
Ley called cirro-filum, or thread cirrus, and his name can hardly be
bettered. It is a cloud of summer, and occurs rather high up in the
cirrus zone, but no actual measurements can be quoted. It is fairly
common, but not nearly so frequent as the last.</p>

</div>

<p>A somewhat more familiar variety is shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_8">8</a>. Little
irregular feathers of cirrus, from which long tapering streamers point
downwards in graceful curves, or else lag behind in the direction
from which the clouds have travelled. If clouds of this type are
carefully watched, it will soon be seen that each feathery head is a
centre of condensation, and that the tails or streamers are nothing
else than falling particles, which dwindle slowly away by evaporation,
and which gradually sink below the level of the heads. It is usual,
in dealing with cloud-forms like these, to speak of air-currents
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
different velocities almost as if the winds at different levels were
as clearly separated as oil and water, or even air and water. This can
hardly be the case, for if such a thing should occur as an air-current
of one velocity flowing over another of less speed, or of a current in
one direction over another moving in a different course, the two must
inevitably mix at their junction, and in a very short time the passage
from the lower current to the upper one would be quite gradual. No
doubt we can often observe two, three, or more layers of cloud moving
in different directions; but if we were to send up a balloon, it would
be rare indeed to find its direction of horizontal movement changed in
a few metres of ascent. Different and distinct air-currents are often
invoked to explain cloud-forms quite unnecessarily. It is far more
likely that the differential movements involved in the explanation of
the features of these cirrus varieties are due to increased velocity
with greater altitude, to progressive change of direction, to irregular
eddies, or to the interaction of ascending and descending convection
currents. Indeed, it is probable that careful study of the growth
and decay of these clouds will, in time, lead to a clearer<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
understanding of atmospheric movements, and so enable us to say more
precisely why they are as we see them to be. The variety shown in Plate
8 is rare except in combination with other forms. It might well be
termed tailed cirrus or cirrus caudatus.</p>

<p>The form of cirrus shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_9">9</a> is far more frequently seen
than either of those which have been described. In this the fibrous
texture is very imperfect, and the cloudlets show a tendency to arrange
themselves in a kind of ribbed structure in two directions almost at
right angles to each other. But this last is an accidental feature
of the particular example, and not in any way a specific character
of the cloud. The reason for regarding it as a distinct variety is
the total absence of sharply defined lines, not only the heads of
condensation, but even the long streamers attached to them being
uniformly hazy and ill-defined. It is a form of cirrus which comes
at all seasons, but most frequently in summer; it moves always with
great slowness, indicating a quiet atmosphere free from disturbance
of any kind. The conditions necessary for its appearance are a
nearly uniform distribution of pressure over a considerable area,
chequered by little shallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> depressions of some trifling fraction
of an inch. In hot weather these are the conditions under which
thunder-storms develop, and this hazy cirrus, or cirrus nebulosus, may
be taken as a certain sign of such an atmospheric state.</p>

<p>So far as permanency of form is considered, hazy cirrus is one of
the most persistent, and affords a marked contrast to the species shown
in Plate <a href="#Plate_10">10</a>, which represents the most fugitive. Five minutes before
the photograph was taken the same part of the sky was a deep, clear
blue, without any trace of cloud. Suddenly a few short curling wisps
made their appearance. These rapidly increased in number, until a
delicate filmy network extended over the greater part of the field of
view. But while the camera was being adjusted for an exposure, part of
the net had broken up into the granular structure shown in the lower
part of the photograph. The granulation rapidly spread through the
net, almost as if the fibres had been curdled, and five minutes later
the whole had been converted into a patch of cirro-cumulus which soon
fused into a uniform sheet. Meanwhile the same series of phenomena were
taking place in other parts of the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>On other occasions exactly the same set of events have been seen
to follow each other in the inverse order. Beginning with a fairly
even sheet, this broke up into granules, and they in turn seemed to be
frayed out into short hazy and wavy fibres which slowly melted away.</p>

<p>Clearly we have here to do, not with a distinct type of cloud, but
rather with the first step towards the formation of one, or the last
stage in the life of one which is drying up. But sometimes the life of
the cloud is so short that it never passes beyond this first stage;
and it is by no means a universal rule for a growing sheet of cirrus
to pass through this stage at all. It therefore represents a peculiar
state of instability, and requires a name of its own. Sometimes patches
of it will come and go in an apparently capricious manner for an
hour or more before permanent condensation is effected or before the
sky finally clears. But this is a rare event, since the slow change
of conditions which has brought the stratum of air to the unstable
condition is generally progressive, and instead of stopping at the
critical point, goes beyond it, with the result that the condensation
grows or the cloud disappears entirely.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> Change cirrus, or cirrus
inconstans, would be an appropriate name for a kind of cloud which is
so plainly indicative of instability.</p>

<p>The critical condition referred to is, of course, that in which a
particular stratum of air is just saturated, or is just on the point
of forming visible cloud. If any cause is brought to bear on such a
stratum which brings about even slight cooling, cloud must be produced;
and, conversely, anything which results in the slightest heating must
cause it to disappear. The shortness and haziness of the fibres, and
the fact that they gather themselves into granules, shows that the
cloud is formed in a stratum of air which is either still, or is moving
as a whole, without any of those differential movements which seem to
be necessary for the longer fibrous details.</p>

<p>The causes which may bring about the local cooling and heating are
easy to understand when we remember how the air will be affected by the
uneven contours of the ground. As it passes over hill and valley the
up-and-down movements of the lower layers, or even the disturbances
caused by passing over a wood or clump of trees, all must be propagated
upwards. Each disturbance must slowly<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> spread laterally and
diminish vertically, so that it will reach the cirrus zone as a broad
and gentle dome-like oscillation. Suppose now a series of such slight
upheavals to reach the critical level. The passage of the waves will
mean alternate expansion and compression. Expansion means cooling, and
therefore cloud-production; compression means heating, and therefore
the destruction of cloud.</p>

<p>From the most transient form of cirrus we pass, in Plate <a href="#Plate_11">11</a>, to the
most persistent and probably the most frequent. It occurs in detached
masses which have very variable forms but are wholly fibrous, with
the details arranged in a very irregular manner. The example figured
was taken in the evening during a long spell of fine weather. If
such a cloud is watched, its permanence of detail is very striking,
and must be due to a persistence of slow eddying movements and to a
continual renewal and waste of the component particles of each wisp.
This is the kind of cirrus selected generally as the type of cirrus,
and the selection is a good one. Common cirrus, or cirrus communis, it
should be called. Settled conditions and fine weather are its usual
attendants.</p>

<p>We next come to a variety which is anything but a harbinger of good,
namely, the long stripes or bands of cirrus which stretch outwards
from the margin of the cloud canopy of a cyclonic storm. In some ways
these appendages to the great nimbus resemble the strips of cirriform
cloud which fringe the summit of a thunder-cloud. They look as if they
must have been formed by the blowing away, by a rapid wind, of the top
of an uprising column of vapour-charged air. Their main outline may
thus be easily accounted for, but we have only to study their detailed
structure for a few minutes to feel that they really present a problem
of a very high order. Plate <a href="#Plate_12">12</a> shows a fairly simple example, but Plate
13 represents a cloud of very great complexity. To take this last the
camera was tilted upwards at an angle of 45 degrees, so that the top of
the picture is not far from the zenith. The wonderful plume of cloud
rose from the southern horizon, and ended in a great sheaf of fibres
and films spread out like a partly opened fan whose edge was only about
50 degrees above the northern horizon. Its length as it passed overhead
lay between a point a little east of south to a little west<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> of
north; and the broad band moved as a whole, without any marked internal
changes, from the south-west towards the north-east. The weather was
very unsettled. A long procession of cyclones had been sweeping along
our western shores, and the barometer was just beginning a fresh and
rapid fall. During the ensuing night a heavy gale burst over the south
of England.</p>

<p>The whole phenomenon was highly characteristic. These great
bands with the divergent striation might well be known as storm
bands, from their almost invariable connection with the violent
atmospheric movements to which they are most probably due. Plate <a
href="#Plate_12">12</a> shows a much less dangerous variety of the same
species, which is distinguished from it by the comparative absence of
internal detail and by the curled ends. Clouds of this character have
sometimes been called cirro-filum, but a comparison of the plates with
the typical cirro-filum of Plate <a href="#Plate_7">7</a> will show
that there is little resemblance; and the attendant weather is also in
marked contrast, both of which facts imply a fundamental difference
in the causes to which their features are due. Banded or ribboned
cirrus is the name which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43"
id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> immediately suggest, and this may be
rendered cirrus vittatus.</p>

<p>This ends our survey of cirrus clouds. Any one who compares the
plates so far given will see that they represent forms so diverse
that it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the conditions
under which they are produced must differ not only in degree but also
in kind. What those conditions are we have attempted here and there
to suggest, but in no case can we feel that the explanation has been
at all complete. In some cases, notably the last, we are face to
face with such complicated details that it is hopeless to attempt to
explain them in the present state of our knowledge. Fact upon fact must
be accumulated until we can give their history from their earliest
beginnings; and far more accurate and detailed knowledge of the
attendant atmospheric conditions must be acquired before we can hope to
rob such elaborate structures of their present mystery.</p>

<p>This requires the co-operation of many eyes and many minds, and
exact specific names must be an essential preliminary. Those which have
been suggested in these pages are&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="chtitle">CIRRO-STRATUS AND CIRRO-CUMULUS</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Several</span> of the varieties
of cirrus already discussed may gather so abundantly at some given
level in the atmosphere, that the most obvious feature comes to be
this arrangement in a sheet. The cloud then becomes cirro-stratus,
and should be so named. We have described how cirro-nebula frequently
grows in density until it fails to produce halo phenomena, and may even
reduce the sun to a hazy patch of light showing no outline. This is the
most typical of all forms of cirro-stratus. It has always a distinctly
fibrous or streaky appearance, whereby it is at once distinguished from
a similar but lower cloud which will be described later on.</p>

<p>A similar sheet may be formed from the fusion together of the
streaks of cirrus-nebulosus, the bands of cirrus vittatus, or the
development of cirrus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46"
id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> inconstans. But the general rule is that
the cirro-stratus retains more or less of the specific characters of
the parent form.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#Plate_14">14</a> shows a hazy form of cirro-stratus developed from the
nebulous cirrus. Its altitude was great, being about 10,000 metres. The
processes of growth and change could be studied easily. First would
appear some faint spots and streaks; these quickly fused together
into larger patches, which again joined to their neighbours. In a few
minutes the cloud so formed would return to the mottled or streaky
appearance, and either disappear entirely or become very thin, only
to recommence the process. This went on for more than an hour, the
cloudy patches getting larger and larger, until the critical condition
was passed, and the sky was covered with a general veil of typical
cirro-stratus.</p>

</div>

<p>In Plate <a href="#Plate_15">15</a> we have an example of a cloud which is clearly
cirro-stratus, but the sheet is broken up into long bands, and
each of these is made up of common cirrus. In the upper part of
the picture the sprays of cirrus are forming, and as they come
into being they are arranged in rows. We have here to do with a
phenomenon of a very different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47"
id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> order from the one presented by the true
banded cirrus. The arrangement into belts must here be due to some kind
of wave-movement in the air, breaking up the critical plane into long
ribs transverse to the direction of the wave-movement. The specimen
shown was moving in a direction nearly at right angles to the bands,
though the surface wind was nearly parallel to their length. The
question at once presented itself as to whether the movement of the
bands was really a drift of the cloud, or whether it was not a case
of the propagation of cloud production with the advancing wave. This
was easily answered by watching the details of a band. The advancing
side was always feathery, and careful observation showed that the
edge advanced by throwing out new threads and curls. A given thread
or curl, one moment at the edge, would in a few minutes be well in
the band. Quite opposite events were taking place in the rear of each
band. The cloud was there obviously melting away. Indeed, to sum the
matter up, the cloud bands flowed past their details just as the waves
on the sea flow past the floating foam. Evidently we have in Plate
15 the result of a plane of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48"
id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> commencing cirrus formation broken into
a series of troughs and waves by an undulatory movement of the air.
But, as we have already said when speaking of cirrus inconstans, the
condition in which trifling up-and-down movements can determine whether
condensation shall, or shall not, take place seldom lasts long. It is
usually only a stage in a continuous change, and in this particular
instance the banded structure was soon replaced by a fairly continuous
sheet of typical cirro-stratus.</p>

<p>The next plate, No. 16, shows a similar process. In the upper part
we have cirrus inconstans forming in patches out of a deep clear-blue
sky. Its hazy fibres grow closer and closer, betraying a slight
tendency to gather in narrow ripple-like bands, but the structure is
soon lost in the uniform white sheet of interlacing fibres, which
differ from common cirrus in little else than their number and
closeness. Nevertheless, the stratiform arrangement is quite obvious
enough to warrant the use of the term &#8220;cirro-stratus.&#8221;</p>

<p>The change of cirro-nebula into cirro-stratus is shown in
Plate <a href="#Plate_4">4</a>, to which reference has already been made. The structures
are remarkably delicate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49"
id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> showing in the middle a distinct irregular
mottling; and rather further towards the top right-hand corner a ripple
structure appears, and in the top left-hand corner the sheet is denser
and whiter. The altitude of this cloud was evidently great, and actual
measurement showed it to be 7&middot;6 miles. It did not last long, and
after its change into broken patches of denser cirro-stratus, still
higher clouds were revealed through the gaps.</p>

<p>Cirro-stratus often forms almost simultaneously at more than
one level, and when that happens the full stratiform appearance is
generally reached first by the lower layer. In Plate <a href="#Plate_17">17</a> we have two
layers. The fluffy bits of cirrus nebulosus, in the lower part of
the picture, are really the higher clouds. Below them, probably by
many thousands of feet, floats the denser cloud shown in the upper
part of the picture. This is an interesting link between the fibrous
and the granular forms of cirrus, and is probably best described
as spotted cirro-stratus, or cirro-stratus maculosus. It is a form
very frequently met with, but seldom showing any persistence. It is
indicative of condensation in a calm atmosphere, and not unfrequently
marks either the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50"
id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> irregularities of pressure which form the
conditions for thunderstorms, or the beginning of the break up of an
anticyclone.</p>

<p>A coarser texture and greater density are shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_18">18</a>,
where we have cirro-stratus in the lower part of the picture, and
cirro-cumulus in the upper. The altitude of this cloud was only
about 4000 metres, one of the least values recorded at Exeter for
cirro-stratus of any kind. The intimate admixture of the fibrous and
granular forms is very clearly shown.</p>

<p>This close relation is equally obvious in Plate <a href="#Plate_19">19</a>, where the
cloudlets are arranged in loosely marshalled rows, dimly resembling
the banded structure of Plate <a href="#Plate_15">15</a>. But in this case the direction
of movement was with the long lines, and the propagation of cloud
production followed the same course. Some of the little cloudlets
have an opacity, and therefore brilliancy, quite unusual for
cirro-cumulus, but their intimate association evidently in the same
plane with undoubted cirrus shows that they must fall under that
general description. It is a cloud indicative of unsettled weather,
and the exceptional brilliancy is doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> due to an unusual quantity
of vapour at the cloud plane, which must mean that the change from
the dry stratum above to the damp one below must be much more sudden
than is ordinarily the case. Clouds of this kind might well be called
cirro-stratus cumulosus.</p>

<p>We now come to two companion pictures, Plates <a href="#Plate_20">20</a> and <a href="#Plate_21">21</a>, which were
taken within half a minute of each other. In the first the camera
was directed towards the west, and in the second it was facing the
north-west. The sun was nearing the horizon, and was only just outside
the field of view in each case, so that the two photographs form a
panorama of the western sky. A solar halo had disappeared about half an
hour previously, and the cirro-nebula had changed into the remarkable
forms of cloud depicted. Plate <a href="#Plate_21">21</a> shows cirrus ripples in the upper
part, and cirro-cumulus in soft, ill-defined balls in the lower part;
but they were at the same level, and are only different parts of the
same cloud plane. In Plate <a href="#Plate_22">22</a> we see similar ball-like cloudlets
ranged in long lines which run almost at right angles to the ripples
of the companion picture. Clouds like these are rare. They<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> are
almost unknown during the early part of the day, and, so far as the
writer&#8217;s experience goes, they are only to be found in the
afternoon towards sunset. Some of our most gorgeous sunset skies are
due to them; for their altitude is considerable, and they do not light
up with the sunset colours until the lower clouds have become dark
shadows against the glowing background. The hottest months of the
year, the still air and great evaporation which are the contributing
causes of thunderstorms, are also the conditions under which such
skies may be seen. Indeed, while these photographs were being taken,
heavy thunderstorms were in progress within less than a hundred miles.
Cirro-cumulus nebulosus, or hazy cirro-cumulus, describes the form
correctly.</p>

<p>The next plate, No. <a href="#Plate_22">22</a>, gives a view of an evening sky about half an
hour after sunset. The lower clouds, cirro-cumulus and cirro-stratus,
of a deep purple brown, standing out dark against a gold-coloured sheet
of higher cirro-stratus, which comes out white in the photograph, while
the purple-tinted sky comes dark. We have here three distinct layers,
all cirrus. First, the hazy cirro-cumulus,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> forming two bars across the
lower part of the picture; then long bands of cirrus or cirro-stratus,
best seen in the bottom right-hand corner; and, far above both, the
cirro-stratus which was reflecting the yellow sunlight. Such a sky
might be an indication of thunder conditions, or it might be due to an
unusual quantity of vapour in the atmosphere produced by some other
cause. The actual conditions were the gentle flow over England of
vapour-laden air from the western ocean, heralding the change from a
long spell of fine hot weather, due to a July anticyclone, to a month
of heavy rains and western gales, accompanying the passage of a long
procession of cyclones along our western shores.</p>

<p>Again, a marked contrast is shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_23">23</a>. Here we have the
highest and thinnest form of cirro-cumulus, the one named cirro-macula
by Mr. Ley. It is rarely, if ever, seen before eleven o&#8217;clock
in the morning, and is far commoner in the afternoon. The example
shown was photographed at sunset at the close of a day which had
been almost cloudless. Cirro-macula forms here and there in a clear
sky. A hazy, whitish patch appears, which at first shows no definite
structure, but looks almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54"
id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> like a little bit of cirro-nebula. This
suddenly splits up by clear blue lanes running through it, and cutting
the patch up into irregular segments, which quickly round themselves
off into minute bits usually whiter on their edges and semi-transparent
in the centre. The process can be strikingly imitated by scattering on
water some fine powder which will float. If left without disturbance,
the particles draw together into numerous small groups, leaving lanes
of clear water between them.</p>

<p>Cirro-macula frequently gives rise to the fibrous form of cirrus
we have called cirrus caudatus. The granules of the cirro-macula grow
denser, and begin to drop their frozen particles as soon as they
become large enough. Indeed, a cloudlet of cirro-macula may sometimes
be seen to turn bodily into a fine line of falling crystals, which
will be a curving line of cirrus. On the other hand, it will sometimes
remain visible for an hour or more without any trace of descending
streaks or floating fibres. Pure cirro-macula such as Plate <a href="#Plate_23">23</a> is not
often seen; it is far more frequently mixed with more solid-looking
cloudlets and descending fibres, such as are shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_24">24</a>, which
gives the same point of view as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55"
id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> 23, but a quarter of an hour later, and
photographed with a longer focus lens. These two photographs, together
with 20 and 21, give excellent examples of the use of the black
mirror. In none of the four could the naked eye detect all of the
cloud structures. The whole sky was a blaze of dazzling light, but by
adjusting exposure and development the details are fully brought out
without the least difficulty.</p>

    <p>CIRRUS CAUDATUS AND CIRRO-MACULA.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Cirro-stratus, we see from the examples which have been considered,
hardly deserves to be treated as a distinct genus of cloud. Its
formation is identical with that of many species of cirrus, or in some
cases with that of the speckle cloud, cirro-macula, or even the coarser
kinds of cirro-cumulus. The different varieties which it shows are best
rendered by reference to the specific names of the detached forms which
have similar features.</p>

<p>Cirro-cumulus, on the other hand, does present clearly
marked varieties. Cirro-macula is so distinct that it might
well be given the name awarded to it by Mr. Ley, while the term
&#8220;cirro-cumulus&#8221; is reserved for the coarser and rounder
forms. The hazy, ripple-like structures of Plate <a href="#Plate_4">4</a> and Plate <a href="#Plate_20">20</a><span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> should
also have some distinctive appellation, as will be suggested later on
when dealing with wave clouds as a whole.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find any short way of expressing the various
ideas which should be summed up in the name of a cloud. There seems
no alternative to the use of additional words, unless it be to follow
the example of chemists, and compound appalling names similar to
those which terrify the uninitiated who think they would like to read
something about, let us say, the coal-tar dyes.</p>

<p>If a cloud belongs to the order cirrus, is in a level sheet, and
that sheet is composed of interlacing or curling fibres, like those
of common cirrus, we can hardly express the facts more briefly than
by calling it cirro-stratus communis, or common cirro-stratus. If
it consists of cirrus bands fused together, but still showing the
banded structure, it is cirro-stratus vittatus. Again, if it is finely
speckled, like cirro-macula, it may be described as cirro-stratus
maculosus, and if the structure is coarser it may be called
cirro-stratus cumulosus.</p>

<p>As a general average, cirro-stratus lies somewhat lower in
the atmosphere than the detached forms,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> probably because the
conditions which give rise to the latter reach to greater altitudes
in patches than it is possible for them to reach in a continuous
manner. Vapour becomes rarer with increased height and with diminished
temperature, so that it must, on the whole, be less frequently present
in cloud-producing quantity as the height increases. At great altitudes
it will be seldom that the quantity is great enough to produce a
stratiform cloud, though it may well be enough for cirro-macula, or the
detached forms of cirrus, like cirrus excelsus.</p>

<p>The production of cirro-cumulus and cirro-stratus sometimes spreads
across the sky with astonishing speed, and this rapid advance of the
edge of the cloud may lead to quite mistaken ideas as to the velocity
of the wind at that altitude. In the case of cirro-cumulus, or
cirro-macula, it is easy to fix attention on a single cloudlet. If this
has the usual ball-like form, it can only be regarded as floating in
the air and moving with it. Meanwhile new cloudlets may be forming and
growing denser, so that the cloud patch as a whole may be apparently
advancing at a much greater rate. Careless observation would then
lead to the idea that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58"
id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> cloud was moving much faster than it
really is, but if the attention is rigidly fixed on a particular
cloudlet the mistake is impossible. If the cloud is a variety of
cirro-stratus, it is not always easy, or even possible, to distinguish
between the advance of condensation and the movement of the whole, but
it can nearly always be done if the cloud shows any definite features
upon which attention can be fastened. Sometimes none sufficiently
marked can be seen, and when that happens it is still possible in most
cases, by watching the edge of the cloud-mass, to see whether new cloud
is being added to that edge. The wave-like forms present a special
case, which will be dealt with in a later chapter, after the general
principles of cloud formation have been discussed in connection with
the great clouds of the lower air, whose causes and conditions are far
better understood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="chtitle">ALTO CLOUDS</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">From</span> cirro-cumulus
and cirro-stratus we pass through almost insensible gradations to
the denser forms classed together in the alto group. These clouds
are fundamentally different, in that they are always composed
of liquid particles, though there is no doubt, from their great
altitude, that their temperature must often be many degrees below the
ordinary freezing-point of water. When this is the case, they are not
unfrequently more or less mixed with streaks and filaments exactly like
those described under the name of cirrus, which have been explained
as due to slowly falling snowflakes. It is not immediately obvious
how such apparently contradictory statements can be reconciled. The
explanation is that minute droplets of water may be cooled many degrees
below freezing-point without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60"
id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> changing into ice, and that such
super-cooled droplets congeal instantly if a few of them join together
to form a larger drop. Practically the same process may be watched any
day when there is a sharp frost and dense fog drifting slowly along.
The fog-particles are liquid, and produce optical effects in the
neighbourhood of any brilliant light, like an arc lamp, absolutely the
same as those which would be produced if the temperature were above
freezing-point, while there are none of the different phenomena which
might be expected if the particles were crystalline ice-dust. As these
liquid particles drift along they come in contact with branches of
trees and other obstacles, the surface stratum which surrounds them and
binds them into spheres is broken, and the drop instantly solidifies.
It is to be noted, moreover, that the drop does not freeze as such,
but merely adds some more particles to the branching crystals of hoar
frost, which grow outwards always towards the direction from which the
fog is drifting.</p>

<p>Most liquids, when freed from contact with solid bodies, or
when surrounded by a smooth envelope of uniform character, can
be cooled below their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61"
id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> normal freezing-point without
solidification taking place; but the introduction of a particle of
the solid, or sometimes of any foreign body, instantly brings about a
rapid freezing of the whole. These phenomena of surfusion, as it is
called, have long been known, and many of them are very interesting
and difficult to understand. Indeed, it is probable that we shall have
to add largely to our knowledge of the forces which bind the molecules
of a body together to form a solid, and which direct the processes of
crystallization before we shall be able to interpret with any certainty
a series of facts depending on the attributes of those very forces.</p>

<p>Water is no exception. If finely divided, as by placing it in fine
capillary tubes, in the pores of wood, or in the narrow spaces of a
wick, it may be cooled several degrees below normal freezing-point.
In a cloud, or fog, all the conditions necessary for surfusion to
take place are undoubtedly present. The water is pure, the envelope
is uniform, the subdivision is exceedingly minute, and the drops are
free from most of the mechanical disturbances which bring about the
solidification of larger masses in the laboratory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62"
id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus we see there is nothing at all surprising in the fact that
clouds composed of liquid particles may exist at temperatures below
the ordinary freezing-point. On the contrary, we should expect that
the solidification of the cloud particles would not take place until
the temperature was many degrees below freezing, as is certainly the
case with clouds of the cirrus order. At temperatures between this
unknown, but low value, and the normal freezing-point, the clouds will
be composed of liquid; but when the particles join together, snowflakes
will result instead of raindrops; and this will be just as true of
alto clouds as it is of the great vaporous mountains of the lower
regions of the air which bring falls of snow. The streaks often mixed
with alto-cumulus are cirrus threads, and are, no doubt, of exactly
the same nature as the tails of cirrus caudatus, or even the fibres of
cirro-filum.</p>

<p>The simplest alto cloud is alto-stratus. When this is complete,
so as to cover the sky, it can be distinguished from cirro-stratus
by the absence of fibrous structure, and by the facts that it never
produces any halo or fragment of a halo, but instead surrounds the
sun or moon with a white blur, or, if<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> it is thin enough, with
a close ring of coloured light much nearer than a halo, and with the
colours in the inverse order&mdash;that is, with the red furthest from
the centre. Some of these so-called coron&aelig; are very beautiful
when seen in the black mirror, and some of those formed around a full
moon show quite brilliant tints to the unaided eye. Of course, these
meteorological coron&aelig; have no relation whatever to the true solar
corona; they are simply formed by the passage of the rays of light
through the veil of small particles, and may be easily imitated. Take a
piece of glass such as a lantern-cover glass, breathe on it, and hold
it close before the eye while looking at some small source of light. If
the dew deposit is thin, bright colours are shown in a luminous ring
surrounding the light, and the thinner the deposit of dew the larger
the ring will be. Breathe heavily so as to give a thick deposit, and
the light will be seen to be the centre of a patch of white brightness
without any colour.</p>

<p>The phenomena are due to what is known as diffraction, and if the
other conditions are unchanged the diameter of the ring is inversely
proportional to the size of the particles. Purity of colour in<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> these
rings is an indication of uniformity in the size of the particles.
When the moon is shining through a sheet of alto-stratus, which thins
off to one edge, very beautiful effects may often be noticed, and the
change from the colourless blur, when a thicker part of the cloud
is interposed, to the brilliant colours of the corona formed by the
thinner edges is very striking. Similar phenomena are shown almost
equally well by any of the alto clouds, but cirrus thin enough to
produce a coloured corona will generally produce a halo.</p>

<p>Alto-cumulus of the kind most nearly allied to cirro-cumulus
is shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_25">25</a>. The upper part of the picture shows ragged,
irregular patches, with slight indications of fibrous streaks. The
lower portion shows rounder, ball-like cloudlets, a few of the larger
of which have distinct shadows on the side away from the sun. This
plate gives alto-cumulus in a partly formed condition, but it is
not a mere passage form. Sometimes exactly such a cloud will float
overhead for hours, showing very little movement and only slow changes
of detail. It is therefore a distinct variety, and may be called
alto-cumulus informis.</p>

<p>A less definite form is shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_26">26</a>. It may also be regarded
as only partly formed, but its construction is quite different, every
part being misty and ill defined. It is a common cloud, especially in
sultry summer weather with still air. Under those circumstances, after
a hazy morning, it may be seen slowly forming during the afternoon,
growing in density as the hours go by, until it reaches a maximum about
five or six o&#8217;clock, after which it melts away, or settles down
into small patches of high stratus. Most frequent in summer, it is by
no means rare in autumn and winter, but still air is essential. From
its hazy appearance it may be called alto-cumulus nebulosus.</p>

<p>Fixity of detail and slow movement characterize both the foregoing
forms, and in that respect our next picture (Plate <a href="#Plate_27">27</a>) shows a cloud
which is a great contrast. Its detached cloudlets are rather flatter
and thinner, and though the cloud as a whole will often persist for
hours, it is undergoing continual change, and is formed when the air
is far from still. Cloudlets form and gather into stratiform patches,
which soon break up again and disappear; and the process goes on
here and there, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66"
id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> accompanied by fairly rapid movement of
the patches as a whole. This cloud may be described as alto-cumulus
stratiformis.</p>

<p>We now come, in Plate <a href="#Plate_28">28</a>, to a cloud of singular beauty. It
forms rapidly in a clear sky, its first traces bearing a striking
resemblance to cirro-macula, but the floccules, instead of remaining
semi-transparent or dropping cirrus threads, rapidly become opaque
balls of cloud which lengthen upwards. This upward tendency causes
the formed cloudlets to have their longer axes vertical, which is
very characteristic. It might be named alto-cumulus castellatus,
or high-turreted cloud. Mr. Ley named it stratus castellatus, or
turret-cloud, but it certainly belongs to the cumulus section of
the alto group. Thunder weather is the invariable condition for
its production. If it is seen, at least in England, thunderstorms
are certain to be recorded not very far away. When this particular
photograph was being taken in South Devon, very destructive storms were
recorded in Brittany and in the English Midlands, and the anvil-shaped
tops of unmistakable thunder-clouds were visible above the horizon
while the exposure was being made.</p>

<p>Another form of almost equal beauty is shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_29">29</a>. The
rounded balls make their appearance as semi-transparent spots upon
the sky, and in their general characters might easily be mistaken for
cirro-macula. But a few minutes will be enough to decide the question.
The little spots rapidly grow denser, frequently becoming ragged at
the edges; they never drop down the slender filaments which usually
descend from cirro-macula, and their edges are never denser than their
central parts, which, it will be remembered, was a frequent feature
of the true speckle cloud. The cloudlets are obviously rounded balls
arranged in patches, which may turn gradually into alto-stratus by
their fusion, or, after an existence of minutes or hours, the whole
may disappear by a disintegration of each ball, by its breaking up
into a ragged mass and melting away. The altitude at which this cloud
forms is between 5000 and 9000 metres, according to measurements made
by the writer, the actual specimen figured being about 7000. It is
almost as characteristic of thunder weather as the last, but whereas
Plate <a href="#Plate_28">28</a> shows a variety which is most often seen before 3 p.m., since
it only occurs while the cloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68"
id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> planes are rapidly rising, the one before
us may be formed at almost any time of day, but most frequently occurs
in the afternoon. An imperfect form of it is frequently met with about
sunset, in which the rounded balls are not usually so well defined as
when the sun is high above the horizon. Alto-cumulus glomeratus would
be a suitably descriptive name.</p>

<p>If it were possible to take a good typical example of the variety
just described and roll it flat, so that each cloudlet should be
reduced to a lenticular shape, we get a type which seems seldom to
appear during the heat of the day, and to be most frequent about
sundown. It consists, as shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_30">30</a>, of distinct cloudlets,
with considerable spaces between them, and gives the impression
of a discontinuous level sheet. But the component cloudlets are
much too definite, and preserve their individuality far too well
to suggest any idea of a broken stratus; the spotted structure is
the predominant feature, while the stratiform arrangement is almost
equally plain. Alto-stratus maculosus would be a suitable term.
It is not so high a cloud as the glomeratus type, the one shown
being at an altitude of about 5600 metres. The plate shows the
position of the setting sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69"
id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> which is partly hidden behind some dark
patches of broken alto-stratus (fracto-alto-stratus), the hazy form
and boundaries of which form an effective contrast to the shining
cloudlets 2000 metres or so above them. Many of our most beautiful
sunsets are due to this form of cloud, particularly in the late autumn.
It is a cloud of calm weather, and often floats apparently motionless,
and undergoing little change, like flakes of glowing fire against the
background of a fading sky long after the sun has disappeared. It is
not indicative of thunder conditions, and it may occur on the margins
of an anticyclone.</p>

<p>A lower and coarser form of the spotted alto-stratus is shown in
Plate <a href="#Plate_31">31</a>, where it is seen through the gaps in a thin sheet of broken

hidden by the denser bit of stratus in the bottom left-hand corner.</p>

<p>Alto-stratus does not often, if ever, grow from the fusion of the
cloudlets of the maculosus type. But it does come from alto-cumulus
glomeratus, and also from a form shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_32">32</a>. Here we have
alto-stratus in process of growth. Small irregular lumps of cloud
forming on the right-hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70"
id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> side of the picture grow larger and more
irregular, begin to fuse together towards the centre, and on the
left-hand side the fusion is almost complete. Still, although the sky
is covered with cloud, the lumpy form is plainly visible. The term
&#8220;alto-strato-cumulus&#8221; is suitable, as it differs from the
more frequent and much lower cloud, which will be described further on
as strato-cumulus, in little else than altitude and general massiveness
of texture. This high strato-cumulus is common enough, too common,
indeed, in England, as it produces many a dull grey sky both in summer
and in winter. In the latter season it is not unfrequent with the cold
east winds of February and March. It is probably the lowest of the alto
clouds; the lowest measurement made by the writer being 1828 metres at
Exeter, but lower altitudes seem to have been recorded elsewhere.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="chtitle">LOWER CLOUDS</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> clouds of the lower
portions of the atmosphere are formed in regions where water vapour
is abundant, and frequently in easy reach of the strong ascending
and descending air currents produced by the varying temperatures and
irregular surface of the ground. It is sufficient to recite these
conditions to show that these lower clouds will be denser, larger,
coarser in texture, and characterized by greater definiteness of form
than those we have, so far, considered.</p>

<p>In the International system they are classified thus&mdash;</p>

<p>Group C. Lower clouds.</p>

<p class="inset">(<i>a</i>) Strato-cumulus.<br />

<p>Group E. High fogs.</p>

<p class="inset">Stratus.</p>

<p>This is certainly the least satisfactory part of the whole
scheme, and it is not at all easy to see upon what grounds it was
adopted by the International Committee. Group D&mdash;cumulus and
cumulo-nimbus&mdash;do show important differences from the other
groups, though it is often difficult to say whether the sky should be
described as covered with strato-cumulus or as covered with numerous
small cumulus. It is the separation of stratus&mdash;placing it in a
group by itself, and making that the lowest&mdash;which is the worst
point. As a matter of fact, stratus may exist at any altitude from
sea-level up to such heights that we should not hesitate to call it
alto-stratus. Indeed, there is no essential character of alto-stratus
which distinguishes it from some of the lower forms. Whatever its
altitude, its thickness and the size of its particles may vary in a
precisely similar manner. We may have the particles exceedingly small,
when the fog will be dry, and such a stratus may be so thin as hardly
to dim the sun; or it may be so thick as to completely hide it. On
the other hand, the fog may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73"
id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> consist of particles easily visible to the
naked eye, forming the so-called Scotch mist, or the &#8220;dry&#8221;
fog of Dartmoor, which will wet things as rapidly and more thoroughly
than a smart shower. When such a fog accumulates to a sufficient
depth, the particles in their fall pick up others, and the result is
a distinct fine rain. This may occur not only near the ground, but at
almost any level below that at which the cloud would pass into the
region of cirrus.</p>

<p>Plate <a href="#Plate_34">34</a> shows three layers of stratus, in each case much broken up.
The highest layer is a good example of alto-stratus maculosus. Lower
down, by half a mile or more, come parts of a grey sheet considerably
denser and thicker. It is a matter of taste whether this should be
called high stratus or low alto-stratus. There is no test by which
the one can be distinguished from the other. Lower again come the
detached darker clouds, which are fragments of a sheet of stratus
which is breaking up and disappearing. The photograph was taken in the
afternoon, after a wet morning, and all three layers were probably
relics of the great rain-cloud system, or nimbus, which produced the
rainfall.</p>

</div>

<p>We have referred to the production of fine rain<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> from a
thick fog. If now such a thick layer of coarse-grained fog&mdash;if
we may use such a phrase&mdash;is suspended overhead at a moderate
altitude, the result is a drizzling rain underneath, and the
cloud at once becomes a nimbus. When Luke Howard adopted the term
&#8220;nimbus,&#8221; he proposed to employ it, apparently, for a
vast mass of cloud such as that which forms the rainy region of a
cyclone; a huge pile of clouds containing representatives of all his
other types in some unknown but close relationship. It was, in fact,
a comprehensive term, and as such there was a good use for it. At
present it is applied to any cloud from which rain is falling, except
when the cloud can be identified as a variety of cumulus which is
called cumulo-nimbus. But we have already said that a stratus may be
a rain-cloud, and so may other varieties. Moreover, whenever a nimbus
breaks sufficiently for us to be able to see its upper surface, we
invariably find that, if it were viewed from above, we should, without
a moment&#8217;s hesitation, place it in one of the other groups. It is
only when we are underneath it we can see its rain-producing character,
and give it the orthodox name. The real fact is that nimbus should
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
an adjective, meaning rain-producing, and not a substantive.</p>

<p>However, it has its allotted place in the International system, and
it is better to adhere as far as possible to a defective but widely
recognized system until it can be authoritatively amended, rather than
to make an individual attempt to ignore it. The facts are sufficiently
obvious, and the days of nimbus as a type are numbered. The two plates,
Nos. 35 and 36, are fair typical representations of the clouds usually
known as nimbus; but they are both of them only the under-surfaces of
other clouds, Plate <a href="#Plate_36">36</a> showing the under-surfaces of a group of heavy
cumulo-nimbus all joined together so as to cover the sky, while Plate
35 shows a mass of dense strato-cumulus. The rain-cloud is always
a form of either stratus or cumulus, or a combination of the two,
sometimes in further combination with clouds of the alto class, or even
extending upwards to cirro-stratus and cirro-nebula. Where it consists
of a single layer, that layer differs from its rainless representative
only in greater thickness from base to summit, or in greater density;
and when there are several distinct layers<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> of cloud, so that the
lowest is shaded by the higher, rain may fall, even though they differ
in no visible way from clouds which would be rainless if alone. Plate
33 is an example.</p>

<p>Nimbus, indeed, is not a type-form, but is merely a typical
condition, and when used as a substantive is only a convenient way
of expressing our ignorance as to the real form of the cloud we so
describe.</p>

<p>The altitude of the base of a rain-cloud may vary considerably.
It may be anything from sea-level up to heights which vary with the
geographical conditions and with the conditions of temperature and
pressure, but probably in this country never greater than 7000 or 8000
metres.</p>

<p>Rain, or snow, often falls from clouds at greater altitudes than
these, but unless in its descent it passes through other lower clouds,
the drops, as a rule, will dry up and disappear. The author has often
seen quite heavy rain descending from a cloud, and disappearing
completely within a thousand feet or so of the cloud-base. On rarer
occasions a still more remarkable thing may be seen&mdash;namely, a
shower falling from an upper cloud into a lower, and none between this
lower cloud and the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77"
id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> This curious phenomenon can only be
explained by supposing that the convection currents which make the
lower cloud are strong enough to support the small raindrops.</p>

<p>Pure stratus is a level sheet of cloud with little variation of
thickness, not ascending every here and there into rounded lumps. Its
most typical form covers the whole sky with a uniform grey pall, which
may or may not completely hide the sun. Such a cloud does not lend
itself to pictorial representation. A frequent form, in which the sheet
is more or less broken, is shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_37">37</a>. This is a variety which
is frequent in the summer mornings, and generally breaks up and clears
away before eleven o&#8217;clock. If, however, it appears in autumn and
winter with layers of alto cloud above, it may grow denser, and turn
into a stratiform nimbus, or it may go on drifting overhead for several
days without sign of change.</p>

<p>Break up such a sheet of cloud by numerous meandering cracks,
and round off the detached pieces so as to give them a more or less
rounded or pyramidal section, and the cloud becomes strato-cumulus,

<p>Plate <a href="#Plate_40">40</a> is a different variety. It is stratiform, each component
cloudlet being rather ragged at the edges. In some ways it resembles
cirro-macula and the speckled varieties of alto cloud, but it
is coarser in texture and obviously at no great altitude. The
International system would call it strato-cumulus, but Mr. Ley gives
a representation from another negative taken at the same time as the
type of what he calls stratus maculosus, a name which seems far more
suitable, since the cloud bears a much closer relation to stratus than
to cumulus. In the particular instance figured, the broken structure
did not last long; the spaces gradually closed in, and a complete
stratus was the result.</p>

<p>Strato-cumulus often lasts for hours, with little or no perceptible
change, but stratus maculosus rarely persists for more than half
an hour. The first is a cloud of fairly stable conditions, the
latter is dependent for its existence upon the near approach<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> to
critical conditions at one particular level, and, as we have said
in other cases, such a critical state is almost always soon passed,
with the result that the cloud either masses into a denser form, or
else breaks up and disappears. If the up and down currents are strong
enough to persist, the result will be strato-cumulus and not stratus
maculosus.</p>

<p>A kind of stratus which is frequently seen in the daytime is shown
in Plate <a href="#Plate_41">41</a>. This is literally a lifted fog, having been formed
about midday, after ground fog in the early morning. It would be
called common stratus, or stratus communis. When it appears it is a
fairly persistent form, sometimes breaking up or swelling up into
strato-cumulus, but more often splitting into long rolls of cloud, with
margins like those of cumulus. This phenomenon is shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_42">42</a>,
which was taken in December at 11 a.m., on a day which opened with a
thick ground fog. A precisely similar cloud is frequent in the early
hours of a summer morning, as a stage in the dispersal of a radiation
ground fog. The fog first lifts from the ground, until it reaches a
height of a few hundred metres, when it splits into the long rolls
whose axes are at right angles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80"
id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> to the direction of drift. The consequence
is very strange if you stand on a hilltop close under the drifting
mass, and look towards the horizon in the direction of drift. The
changing shadows give the impression that the clouds are actually
rolling along, though of course no such thing is really taking place.
As time goes on the rolls grow larger and the interspaces wider; then
transverse fissures appear, and gradually the rolls break up into small
detached cumulus. Cumulus radius, from the Latin for a rolling-pin,
might be a suitably descriptive name, but it should not be forgotten
that it is only an intermediate link between stratus and cumulus,
and, indeed, is more nearly related to the former, since it is never
produced except on the break up of stratus, while it may dry up and
disappear without reaching the cumulus stage at all. Stratus radius
would therefore be a better name.</p>

<p>Cumulus is closely related to another form of stratus, which Mr. Ley
has named stratus lenticularis, but this appears to be so frequently
the last stage in a disappearing cumulus that its history will come
better later on. It is mentioned here as it is, after all, one of the
commonest of all forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81"
id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> stratus, the form which appears at, or
after, sunset, and is one of the few clouds which have an English
popular name&mdash;Fall cloud. Plate <a href="#Plate_47">47</a> gives a representation of it,
standing out dark against an evening sky, with a sheet of alto-stratus
far above it in the upper part of the photograph.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, we have among the lower clouds of more or less
stratiform pattern&mdash;<br />

<span class="inset">Stratus communis, or Common stratus.</span><br />

<span class="inset">Stratus lenticularis, the Fall cloud.</span><br />

<span class="inset">Stratus radius, or Roll cloud.</span><br />

<span class="inset">Stratus maculosus, or Mottled stratus.</span><br />

<span class="inset">Strato-cumulus, or Sheet cumulus.</span><br />

The last leads naturally to the consideration of cumulus and
cumulo-nimbus, while the term &#8220;nimbus&#8221; does not belong to
any one type-form, but sometimes to one, sometimes to another, and
generally to a mixture of two or more.</p>

<p>A good many years ago the writer made a series of measurements
of the thickness of detached clouds of the stratus and cumulus
types, such as those which may produce a shower. The conclusions
reached in consequence of those determinations have since been amply
confirmed by subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82"
id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> observations. In winter no rain will fall
from a cloud unless it reaches a minimum thickness of at least 100
metres, while in summer it must have rather greater thickness. There
is one exception, and that is in winter, when the temperature is so
low that the drop starts on its downward journey as a flake of snow.
When this is the case, rain may fall from a layer of thin lifted fog,
not quite thick enough to hide the blue colour of the sky. But under
ordinary conditions of temperature, if the cloud has a thickness less
than 2000 feet, or 616 metres, rain is unlikely, but if it does come,
the drops will be small and the fall of rain quite trifling.</p>

<p>Above this thickness the heaviness of the rain and size of the drops
increases, so that if the distance from base to summit be between
2000 and 3000 feet, or 600 to 1000 metres, the fall will be gentle. A
thickness of 4000 to 6000 feet, or 1200 to 1800 metres, gives large
drops and a fairly heavy shower, while, in summer time at least,
cold heavy rain and hail come from clouds measuring 6000 to 10,000
feet, or in round numbers 1800 to 3000 metres or more. In winter the
necessary dimensions seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83"
id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> be less, but the rule still holds equally
good, that the rain-cloud does not necessarily differ in any way from
the rainless one, except in thickness, and that when the requisite
thickness is present rain is not always the result.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="chtitle">CUMULUS</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Under</span> the general term
cumulus there are grouped the most common, the best known, and the
grandest forms of cloud. Indeed, beautiful as the cirrus and alto
clouds may be, there is a solid grandeur about the greater forms
of cumulus which gives them a beauty of their own quite comparable
with the charm afforded by the delicate tracery of their more lofty
rivals.</p>

<p>Cumulus can be divided into several types, which are best considered
in the order of growth. They are all formed in the lower part of
the atmosphere, their under-surfaces varying in altitude from about
600 metres, or even less, up to 3000 metres, or slightly more. The
writer&#8217;s own measurements vary from a minimum of 584 metres to
a maximum of 2286 metres, with an average of a little more than 1000
metres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85"
id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>They are described in the International system as &#8220;clouds
in a rising current,&#8221; and there is no doubt the description is
correct. Each cumulus must be looked upon as simply the visible top of
an ascending pillar of damp air. The vapour which makes its appearance
in the cloud is present in the transparent air beneath, and the base of
the cloud is simply the level at which that vapour begins to condense
into visible liquid particles. Since cumulus clouds are caused by
ascending currents, these currents must be brought about either by
the general disturbance of the air due to a cyclonic movement, or by
the local irregularities of temperature on the ground produced by the
sun&#8217;s heat. As a matter of fact, we do get cumulus produced in
great abundance in the rear of every cyclone, and we get them also
under the conditions of still air and hot sun, which specially favour
evaporation and the development of differences of temperature. The
cyclone cumulus may come at any hour of the day or night, though
comparatively rare between midnight and the morning. Heat cumulus is
generally formed during the afternoon, and it is only under relatively
uncommon conditions that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86"
id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> persists during the night. If the cloud
has not grown to very great size it usually begins to break up and
disappear about sunset, but if it has grown to the enormous dimensions
of a summer thunder-cloud it may go on growing, piling mass on to
mass, until it generates a thunderstorm, even in the hours of early
morning.</p>

<p>In the case of some of the higher kinds of cloud, we are not able to
give any certain account of the mechanics of their production from a
study of those clouds themselves. We have already referred incidentally
to some of the speculations as to their origin and some of the facts
definitely known, but considerable light can be thrown on the genesis
of all the varieties of cirro-cumulus and alto-cumulus by a careful
study of their larger and more accessible representatives of lower
regions.</p>

<p>The cyclone cumulus does not differ in any essential from the clouds
of calm weather. The only difference is that the uprising currents are
perhaps partly eddies, and the rate of fall of temperature with ascent
is often more rapid.</p>

<p>Given any mass of air at a particular temperature, it can take
up and hold in the form of invisible<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> vapour a fixed quantity of
water, and no more. When it holds the maximum possible it is said to be
saturated. If it is nearly saturated it would be called damp; if far
from saturated, dry. Now, the warmer the air the larger the quantity of
vapour necessary to saturate it, so that if a quantity is saturated at
a high temperature, and is then cooled, it will no longer be able to
retain all its moisture in the invisible form, but the surplus quantity
will make its appearance as liquid particles, that is to say, as mist
or cloud.</p>

<p>Similarly, if a quantity of air is not fully saturated at its
particular temperature, and is then cooled, it will approach nearer and
nearer to saturation, and if the process is continued long enough the
result will be cloud formation.</p>

<p>All clouds, without exception, are produced by exactly such cooling
of air containing water vapour, first to the temperature at which the
quantity it contains is the maximum possible, and then beyond that
point. Now, if we start with very warm air, and cool it 1 degree,
we decrease its vapour-holding power, and the decrease per degree
grows less and less as the temperature<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> falls. Suppose, for
instance, we have air saturated at 61 degrees and cool it to 60
degrees, the quantity of vapour condensed will be equal to the
difference of holding power. Suppose, again, we have air saturated
at 31 degrees and we cool it to 30 degrees, the quantity of vapour
condensed will again be equal to the difference of holding power;
but this quantity will be very greatly less than in the former case.
Cooling air saturated at 61 degrees to 60 degrees might produce a dense
cloud; but applying a similar reduction of 1 degree to air saturated at
31 degrees, if we take the same volume of air, will only produce a very
much thinner result. Here we see one good reason why the highest clouds
are the thinnest and the alto clouds of intermediate density.</p>

<p>The necessary cooling may be brought about in several ways. Firstly,
the air is capable of radiating its heat into space, and therefore
of cooling. But we know little of the laws which govern atmospheric
radiation, and presumably, if cloud could be produced by such
means, it ought to make its appearance most frequently in the small
hours of the morning before sunrise. We are, however, unaware<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> of
any variety of cloud which answers those conditions, unless it be
the ground fogs which so often form during the night; and these, we
know, are certainly due to the chilling of the air by contact with
the ground, which has been cooled by radiating away its heat. On
the contrary, it is well known to astronomers that the sky is, on
the whole, clearer and freer from clouds after midnight than in the
earlier hours of the night&mdash;a circumstance which is particularly
unfortunate for the amateur star-gazer, who has to be up and about at
the same time as the rest of the working world. Cooling by radiation we
may then dismiss as a cause of cloud formation of no great efficacy,
and certainly one which has little to do with the production of
cumulus.</p>

<p>Cooling by contact with a cold body is another and more potent
cause. We often see it in a mountain district, where a frost-bound
peak stands facing the wind with glittering snow-slopes on which the
sun is shining, while a long tongue of cloud hangs like a banner on
its leeward side. In such a case it is easy to understand how the air
sweeping by the icy mass is chilled below its saturation point; but
as it passes on, the chilled portions become<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> mixed with the rest, and
the cloud evaporates again. It is not quite so easy to see how far this
cause is responsible for the clouds which are formed when the warm damp
air of the ocean drifts over a comparatively cold land. It is probable
that the contact chilling is in this case only part of the explanation,
and that other causes co-operate.</p>

<p>The mixing of warm damp air with cold has often been adduced as a
cause of clouds. No doubt it might be, and some of the stratiform types
may possibly be formed at the junction between a warm damp stratum of
air and a cold one, but no example is certainly known. It may also be a
contributing cause in producing the sharply defined upper surfaces of
some cumulus or strato-cumulus clouds, but these are in the main most
certainly due to the chief cause of cloud production&mdash;namely, what
is known as dynamic cooling.</p>

<p>If a quantity of air exists under a certain pressure and at a
certain temperature, on reducing the pressure it will expand, and
in the act of expanding it will become cooler. This may easily
be illustrated with an air-pump. Let a damp sponge or a piece of
wet blotting-paper stand under a glass<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> receiver over an air-pump
until the air has become damp. If the apparatus is in a darkened
room, and a powerful beam of light from a lantern is sent through the
receiver, the damp air will be seen to be quite clear; but a stroke or
two of the pump removes some of the air, the remainder is chilled by
its own expansion, and a dense cloud is precipitated. If this cloud be
viewed closely, it will be seen to be composed of minute particles,
which, on looking towards the light, glow with the colours of a corona.
In a few minutes the cloud will disappear, but it can be recalled
again and again by successive strokes of the pump, getting thinner and
thinner as the air gets more and more rarefied; an illustration of a
second reason why the high clouds are thinner than the lower.</p>

<p>Some years ago Mr. John Aitken showed that if the damp air used in
this experiment were carefully filtered, so as to remove all foreign
particles, no cloud was produced, and the introduction of a puff of
unfiltered air was attended by immediate condensation. The deduction
was that vapour, even below its saturation temperature, cannot produce
cloud unless nuclei of some sort are already<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> present, presumably dust
particles. Later on it was shown by Mr. Shelford Bidwell and others
that gaseous particles, such as those produced by the burning of
sulphur, would serve the purpose, and that the brush discharge from an
electrified point was in some mysterious way particularly effective.
It has recently been shown by Mr. C. T. R. Wilson that causes such as
the radiations of radium, or the impact of ultra-violet rays, acting on
the air itself, splits up some of its particles into the smaller bodies
known as ions, and that these are efficient nuclei. These experiments
open up many most interesting questions, but, unless it is to explain
the extreme density and darkness of a thunder-cloud, they do not seem
to play any important part in determining the forms to be assumed.
Nuclei in sufficient abundance are probably always present at any
height which can be reached by enough vapour to form a cloud.</p>

<p>Now, if we have a quantity of air, say at sea-level, damp but not
saturated, and it is caused to ascend, either because it is warmer and
therefore lighter than the surrounding air, or for some other reason,
as it moves upwards the pressure upon it<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> will decrease, it will
expand, and in the act it will be steadily cooled. This cooling may
after a time bring it down to the same temperature as the rest of the
air at its particular level. If so, it will no longer be lighter, and
the ascent will come to an end. But before this state of affairs is
attained it may have reached its saturation point, and cloud production
will begin.</p>

<p>It is true that the rarefaction of the air tends to enable it to
retain more vapour than it could if it were cooled without change
of density. The temperature of the air being fixed, its holding
power increases with decrease of pressure. But this increase is much
less than the diminution due to cooling, and the result in nature
must be similar to what we can see happen under the receiver of the
air-pump.</p>

<p>The condensation of water introduces another factor of great
importance. It has just been said that the ascending air may be
cooled so rapidly as to be reduced to the same temperature as the
rest of the air at that level, and if so the ascent will end.
Clearly the cessation or persistence of the upward motion depends
upon whether the diminution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94"
id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> of temperature per 100 metres of ascent is
most rapid in the rising column or in the air outside it. As long as
the ascending air is warmer than that outside, but at its own level, so
long will ascent continue. Now, as long as no condensation was taking
place, the rate of cooling would follow a simple law which produces
a cooling of 1 degree for about 100 metres of ascent; but as soon as
water vapour begins to pass into the liquid form, a large quantity
of heat is set free, and the rate of cooling is consequently greatly
lessened. Cloud production tends, therefore, to accelerate ascent, and
the greater the amount of condensation, the more important will this
consideration become; though, on the other hand, when once the cloud
is formed, it tends to stop the rising current by shading the air and
ground beneath it.</p>

<p>On an ordinary day the rate of decrease of temperature as we ascend
is rather less than the value given above, and uprising currents are
soon checked. If they do extend far enough to reach cloud production,
the clouds will be small, forming the smallest variety of cumulus. This
is shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_43">43</a>. Small irregular uprising currents have<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> just
been able to reach far enough up to have their summits tipped with
cloud.</p>

<p><a id="Plate_43"></a></p>

<p>After the foregoing explanation, it is easy to see why at a given
time the floating cloudlets should have a common base level. This is
the height to which the air must attain before reaching its saturation
temperature. Each cloudlet marks an uprising current, and the intervals
show the position of the counterbalancing descending streams.</p>

<p>A larger variety is shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_44">44</a>. In this the level base and
generally pyramidal shape is shown, and also the hard, rounded upper
surface. The thickness of this cloud was about 500 metres. When clouds
like these are visible, they may be the beginning of larger ones, and
the only way to judge whether they are likely to develop into rain- or
shower-clouds is to watch them. If they are seen to be growing larger,
and particularly if detached fragments are developing into clouds,
further growth is almost certain, and rain is probable.</p>

<p>If great towering masses are making their appearance with little
dark fragments between them, as shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_45">45</a>, then smart showers
may be confidently expected. The cloud figured<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> was a shower-cloud, and
the distance is seen through the veil of falling rain. The height
and thickness of this particular cloud were measured just after its
photograph had been taken. Its base was 1200 metres above the ground,
and its summit was 1500 metres further. Its thickness from summit to
base was, therefore, not much short of a mile, and the total contents
of the cloud were probably between one and a half and two cubic miles.
The upper contour is hard and rounded, as in the smaller cloud of Plate
44, but the whole cloud is much larger.</p>

</div>

<p>We have already explained that there seems to be a definite
connection between the thickness of such clouds and the amount of
precipitation from them. Small cumulus, less than 120 metres thick,
rarely produces rain, and nothing like a heavy shower is likely
unless the thickness exceeds 400 metres. In winter, especially in
hard frost, snow crystals may fall from the smallest cloud, even from
little fragments only a few metres thick, but the quantity of water so
precipitated will, of course, be small.</p>

<p>As long as the top of the cumulus is rounded<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> and
clearly defined, the conditions of a&euml;rial equilibrium are stable,
and the growth of the cloud has been brought to an end by a stoppage of
the ascending current. In Plate <a href="#Plate_45">45</a> the ascent has been hindered both
by the mechanical action of the falling raindrops and by the cooling
of the lower parts of the ascending column by the descent into it of
the cool drops from its colder upper part. This is probably one of the
chief reasons why a shower-cloud never maintains its activity as a rain
producer for more than a very limited period. As the cloud drifts over
the landscape, it seldom maintains its showery character for more than
ten or twenty miles, often for much less.</p>

<p>Cumulus, like any of these three, is a cloud of the daytime. It
generally begins about ten or eleven o&#8217;clock in the morning,
grows larger until about four o&#8217;clock, and then begins to
break up and disappear. After the ascending currents have ceased,
the component cloud particles slowly settle down into the warmer air
beneath, until the mass has lost its proper pyramidal form, and has
become an irregular cloud, such as is shown in Plate 46. This is known
as degraded or fracto-cumulus.</p>

<p>One consequence of the arrest of the uprising currents is the
formation of lenticular patches of stratus, called by Mr. Ley stratus
lenticularis. This is often formed about sunset, and has been named
fall cloud, from its appearance at the fall of night. The name is
appropriate in another way. The ascending currents having ceased,
the cloud particles slowly subside until they dry up in some warmer
stratum. The water vapour does not continue its descent, but slowly
diffuses in all directions, and if the fall of cloud particles is
sufficient, this stratum, which is approximately coincident with the
base of the original cumulus, soon becomes saturated, and further
particles which fall into it remain visible. This saturated zone will
slowly sink lower and lower with the descent of the particles, until it
reaches regions in which the temperature is high enough for the whole
to be evaporated without reaching saturation point. Evening stratus in
calm weather always goes through this sequence of changes. It usually
forms at, or soon after, sundown, and begins to break up and disappear
as the stars are becoming visible in the darkening sky. Plate 47 shows
a specimen of this evening stratus.</p>

<p>A curious feature is sometimes shown on the underside of a thick
cloud, which is probably due to the upper part of the ascending column
having been carried beyond its position of equilibrium by its own
inertia, and then falling back again in the teeth of the still rising
lower part. The result is to give the base of the cloud an appearance
of a number of rounded masses hanging downwards below the cloud, very
suggestive of the idea that the cloud is upside down. Such an event
will not often occur, and when it does the conditions are quite wanting
in stability, and the consequent features will be very transient. When
the base of a cumulus or cumulo-nimbus is so affected, the cloud is
known as festooned cumulus, or cumulus mammatus. A precisely similar
structure may be seen under strato-cumulus, or even thick stratus. In
some countries it seems to be frequently observed, but in England it is
so uncommon that the writer has only noted it about a dozen times in
twenty years, and on no one of these did it last long enough to allow
of its portrait being taken. It is an indication of very disturbed
conditions, and is usually followed by heavy rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100"
id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>When cumulus clouds are formed in air which is steadily moving as
a whole, that is to say, when there is a steady breeze, they have
a very decided tendency to follow each other in long lines. It may
often be noticed that in a particular place with a certain direction
of wind these long processions follow definite tracks in relation to
the geographical features. The phenomenon does not seem to have been
recorded except in hilly country, but has frequently been observed by
the writer. It is not the same thing as the formation of stationary
belts of cloud transverse to the wind. These cumulus float along with
the movement of the air, and the question to be answered is, why should
they follow each other so persistently, and why should the intervening
belts of sky be so continuously free from cloud.</p>

<p>If we consider that the warm damp air which supplies them is drawn
from the ground, it seems that any cause which tends to direct this
warm stratum into definite channels, as it is carried on by the wind,
will be a competent cause of the whole phenomenon. This we find in
the presence of lofty hills which stand in the way of the warm<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
surface winds, causing them to follow more or less the general trend
of the valleys, and so delivering the rising convection currents of
cloud-producing air at the same spot.</p>

<p>It is easy to conceive that other causes, such as a difference in
temperature or dampness of neighbouring tracts, resulting from whether
they are bare or wooded, marshland or sandy plain, might equally
suffice; or might, at least, powerfully co-operate with, or counteract,
the effect of hill and vale. But in any case it is plain that the
geographical conditions to the windward of the place of observation not
only may affect the occurrence and distribution of cloud, but if the
wind is steady it is difficult to see how they could avoid affecting
it.</p>

<p>Another puzzling phenomenon, sometimes presented by cloud and fog,
is that our instruments for detecting humidity show that the air within
them is not always fully saturated. It seems probable that this is due
to such cloud or fog having begun the process of drying up, or that
in some way not fully understood the presence of the cloud particles
after they have first come into existence may cause the withdrawal of
some of the moisture from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102"
id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> intervening damp air. The surface of
each minute droplet exerts a pressure on its interior similar to the
pressure exerted by the film of a soap-bubble on the air within it,
and it is conceivable that some of the uncondensed vapour from outside
may diffuse through this enclosing surface film, and be retained
there in consequence of the pressure. If this is so, and subsequent
investigation can alone decide the matter, it will follow that when
once cloud production has begun it will be continued until the air
between the cloud particles is reduced so far below its saturation
point that the tendency of the drops to evaporate, that is to say, for
the imprisoned water to escape through the confining film, balances the
retaining pressure.</p>

<p>This consideration, however, is quite incompetent to affect the
general explanation of cloud formation which has been given. Its
result would be to carry condensation a little further than the exact
saturation point, and to retard equally slightly the subsequent
evaporation of the cloud particles.</p>

<p>We have spoken of the typical cumulus as having a roughly
pyramidal shape, and if the horizontal movement of the air is
small, the loftiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103"
id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> point of the cloud will be situated
approximately above the centre of its base. But if the horizontal
movement increases in velocity, so that the top is in a more rapidly
moving stratum than the base, it will lean forward in the direction of
movement. This is a very common phenomenon, being generally shown by
cumulus on a windy day.</p>

<p>On much rarer occasions the converse occurs, and the top of the
cloud lags behind the base, the explanation being a lessening of the
velocity of the wind as the height above ground increases. But such
conditions rarely occur, and when they do they are due to local eddies
and affect only a limited area. Hence such clouds are isolated, and
indicate a disturbed state of the air and uncertainty of weather. The
clouds which lean forward are formed under conditions which are spread
over wide districts, such as the rear of a large cyclone, and cumulus
of that kind may follow one another across the sky for hours or even
days as long as the wind persists.</p>

<p>So far we have considered only the round-topped types of
cumulus&mdash;those which mark the tops of ascending currents
whose ascent has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104"
id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> stopped at a comparatively early stage,
or those whose ascent is still in that early stage, though the upward
movement has not yet come to an end. The full story of the growth of
a cumulus is identical with that of the youth of a cumulo-nimbus, the
later stages of which we will consider in another chapter.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="chtitle">CUMULO-NIMBUS</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Grandest</span> of all clouds
are the huge mountains of vapour which are the parents of summer
thunder-storms. They are at once distinguished from ordinary cumulus
by their upper parts, which sometimes reach beyond the region of
the alto clouds high into the realm of cirrus, and extend outwards
as a broad disc, which is occasionally indistinguishable from the
cirro-nebula and cirro-stratus which form the van of a cyclone cloud
canopy. Indeed, there seems to be no essential dividing line between a
large cumulo-nimbus and the cloud pile of a small cyclone, and no real
difference between them except their size.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the term cumulo-nimbus would only be given to
the cloud when a large fraction of the whole can be seen at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106"
id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>In dealing with common cumulus, it has been pointed out that the
cessation of the uprising convection currents which determines the
maximum height to which the cloud will grow is due to the rate of
cooling within the ascending column being greater than the rate of
cooling outside it. It follows that when the ascending current has
reached a certain height it will, as a whole, be just as heavy as an
equal column outside. Ascent must then cease. The equilibrium of the
air in such a case is said to be stable, and the condition of such
stability is simply that the general rate of fall of temperature per
100 metres of ascent is less than the rate of cooling dynamically
produced in an ascending current.</p>

<p>If, however, the general rate of fall of temperature is greater than
that produced dynamically, the consequence will be that the upward
tendency of the rising air will increase as it moves upward, and the
taller the column becomes the greater will be the difference of weight
between the inside and outside columns. In such a case the equilibrium
is said to be unstable, and the result will be the production of
cumulo-nimbus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107"
id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as cumulus may be divided into heat cumulus and the clouds of
the rear of a cyclone, so cumulo-nimbus may be divided into the same
two groups. In the case of the heat thunder-clouds the instability
of the air is effected by the rapid heating of its lower layers in
contact with the ground, those lower layers being so quickly warmed
that there is not time for them to become mixed with the overlying
air in which the rate of decrease is normal. If there is much wind we
rarely get cumulo-nimbus, because the heated air is mixed mechanically
with the overlying parts, and the rate of decrease is approximately
normal throughout. Calm air and hot sun are then one set of necessary
conditions for the production of instability.</p>

<p>But it is well known that thunder-showers and lesser examples of
cumulo-nimbus are by no means infrequent in the rear of a cyclone, and
such storm clouds are usually attended by considerable wind. They are,
as a rule, much smaller than those produced by heat, but they have
the same form, and are evidently due to instability in the lower part
of the air, and the question is how can that condition be produced.
In order to find the answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108"
id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> it is necessary to refer to the
temperature phenomena of a cyclonic area. If a cyclone be divided
into four quadrants by two lines drawn through its centre, one in the
direction in which the system is travelling and the other at right
angles to it, then the front right-hand quadrant is the warmest and
the rear right-hand quadrant much colder. The cumulo-nimbus clouds of
a cyclone are limited to the first part of this cold quadrant, that is
to say, to the portion of the storm in which a great volume of cold
air is flowing over a district which has just been warmed and wetted
by the preceding part. The result is that, the air being warmed by
contact with damp ground at a temperature many degrees above that of
the air itself, we have produced exactly the same unstable state at a
low temperature as we have at a high temperature in the case of heat
storms. The lower temperature of the whole is enough to account for
the smaller volume of the cloud, and that in turn explains why cyclone
thunderstorms are, generally speaking, on a much smaller scale than
heat storms.</p>

<p>The life history of a cumulo-nimbus is easily studied on a suitable
day. The rapid heating of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> the lower layers of air causes
them to expand bodily, and as they do so they lift the overlying
air, frequently in broad domes or waves. The first result is the
expansion of these upper zones, which are lightened by the flowing
away of still higher layers. Expansion means chilling, and sooner or
later its effects become visible in the formation of cirro-stratus,
cirro-cumulus, or alto-cumulus. Simultaneously the heated air near
the ground begins to rise up in tall columns, while the cooler air
from a little higher descends to take its place. Soon patches of lower
cloud appear, at first hazy and indistinct, but gradually shaping
themselves into cumulus with hazy base and rounded summits. These
rapidly assume the typical pyramidal shape, with level base and sharply
contoured top, and so far there is little to distinguish them from
an ordinary cumulus (see Plate <a href="#Plate_48">48</a>). But watch them carefully. Here
and there some will be growing taller than their fellows, and as they
grow their rate of growth increases until the top begins to show signs
of spreading outwards. Rapidly the bulging summit throws out long
fingers of cloud, radiating from the central column almost as if<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
propelled by some repulsive force. At first, these fingers are merely
projecting lumps of cloud with rounded ends, but in a few minutes they
undergo a sudden and striking change. The whole summit becomes frayed
out, drawn out into long radiating lines, which thin off against the
blue sky exactly like the edges of a sheet of cirro-stratus. False
cirrus is the name commonly given to this, but there seems no valid
reason why it should be regarded as &#8220;false.&#8221; The top of
the cloud rapidly spreads horizontally, forming a disc of cirriform
cloud, which sometimes spreads several miles ahead of the rest of the
storm. Meanwhile, the original cumulus column loses all its deep folds
and convolutions, and other round-topped cumulus arise around it until
the completed system consists of a more or less disc-shaped mass of
cumulus, with a common base, rising higher and higher towards some
central point, where these are connected, by an uprushing column of
vapour, to an upper disc with cirriform margins.</p>

<p>These clouds were thunder-clouds, the larger one being a smart
thunderstorm with heavy hail. They were photographed in the evening,
and in the second picture the sun was just below the horizon.</p>

<p>But, to continue the story of a thunder-cloud, we always find that
after a time the cirriform top flattens out and gradually subsides,
and this is usually accompanied by a descent of the cloud base to a
lower level. Meanwhile, it frequently happens that the whole series of
phenomena is repeated in one of the attendant cumulus. Plates <a href="#Plate_51">51</a> and <a href="#Plate_52">52</a>
are also two views of the same cloud at different times. In Plate 51 we
have the main part of the storm on the right, while on the extreme left
a lower part of the cloud is rising rapidly into a tall dome. In Plate
52 the central top has lost its cirriform margin and has distinctly
flattened, while the left-hand dome has risen much higher and is
beginning to throw out the projecting bits.</p>

<p>The hard-topped cumulus which fringe the lower disc, and the
vast pile of cirriform and hazy cloud which forms the centre of a
cumulo-nimbus, are shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_53">53</a>, which represents part of the side
of a great thunder-cloud. In this case the diameter of the lower disc
was about 15 miles, and the upper disc was rather larger. The uprising
column in the middle was about 7 miles across, and the height from base
to summit about 3 miles. The whole system contained between 100 and 150
cubic miles of cloud. When photographed it was over the northern part
of Salisbury Plain. Lightning played repeatedly between the back of the
white cumulus and the hazy mass behind it, and the rumble of thunder
was all but continuous for nearly half an hour as the great cloud
passed by.</p>

</div>

<p>This was an unusually large cloud for this country, but specimens of
10, 20, or 30 cubic miles are quite common.</p>

<p>Now for the explanation of the series of events. To begin with, we
have the production of an ordinary cumulus, but the equilibrium is
unstable, the growth of the cloud, therefore, becomes more and more
rapid, and the rapid condensation adds to<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> the instability until
the rising column is so much lighter than an equal column outside
that a powerful updraught is created, strong enough for a time to
hold up the raindrops or even hailstones. At length the condensation
is complete, the upper part of the cloud consisting of snow crystals
exactly like those of any other cirrus. In the mean time, the rapid
ascending current necessarily involves an indraught from around, and
consequent descending currents to supply it. The result is to set up
a circulating system, moving inwards along the ground, upwards in the
central column, and outwards in the upper disc. The downward currents
are sometimes shown by a curling over of the edges of the upper disc,
but the phenomenon is not often seen, as the descending movement is
generally enough to dry up the cloud particles.</p>

<p>The rapid rising of damp air drawn from the ground brings about
rapid condensation and heavy rain. The large size of thunder-drops is
almost certainly due to the fact that it is only the larger drops which
can fall in the teeth of the strong updraught. But when these drops
begin to fall, and still more when cold hailstones begin to fall<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
through this ascending air, it becomes chilled from top to bottom, and
the column is broken or even stopped altogether. The frozen particles
which make up the top subside gradually, and the chilling of the air
immediately below the cloud brings the saturation level nearer the
ground, and we say the cloud base descends.</p>

<p>The arrangement of a thunder-cloud into the upper and lower discs
with a connecting uprush gives to the typical cloud a shape something
like that of an anvil when seen sideways, but in the larger clouds
the disc-like form is more obvious. In any ordinary thunderstorm the
great majority of the discharges of lightning play between the two
discs, and the larger the cloud the more frequent these are. Such
discharges as pass between the cloud and the earth come exclusively
from the base of the lower disc if the cloud is large, and generally
follow immediately after or simultaneously with one between the two
discs. The phenomena of lightning are intensely interesting, but the
purpose of these pages is confined to the study of clouds and cloud
forms, and it would be going beyond our scope to discuss either
lightning or hail. Both are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115"
id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> however, so closely related to
cumulo-nimbus that they can hardly be passed over in silence. One
thing is certain, and that is that neither the electrical developments
nor the hail has anything to do with the growth of the cloud. On the
contrary, both are consequences of the cloud, the hail being due to
the great altitude, and consequent low temperature of the upper part
of the cloud, and also to the violent uprising currents within it;
while the electrical phenomena are due to either the enormous amount of
condensation, or to friction due to the rapid uprush, or more probably
to the fact that considerable differences of electrical condition exist
in the distant parts of the air connected by the cloud, and between
which its circulating currents move. These differences are known to
exist at all times, and we cannot here discuss their origin.</p>

<p>The formation of cumulo-nimbus and cumulus is dependent upon the
presence of a large amount of water vapour. It is worth while to
consider whether the atmospheric movements which bring about the
condensation could exist without moisture. Wherever we find differences
of temperature between neighbouring places we must get<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
currents of hot air rising from the warmer spots, and compensating
descending currents around them. But we have pointed out that if the
rate of cooling as we ascend in the still air is less than the rate at
which an ascending current will be dynamically cooled, such a rising
current will come to rest. If, on the other hand, the rate of cooling
in the ascending current be less than in the still air, the equilibrium
will be unstable, and a violent uprush will result.</p>

<p>Now, in a climate such as our own, where the lower regions of the
air contain large quantities of water vapour, any considerable rise
brings about more or less condensation, and that condensation is
attended by a liberation of very large quantities of heat, which retard
cooling in the ascending current, and so facilitate the production of
instability. But if this cause is put aside it is still possible to
have a similar circulation. When discussing the causes of instability,
it has been pointed out that the prime condition was an unusually rapid
rate of fall of temperature in still air, such as may be produced by
hot sunshine. Now, these conditions are exactly those which will give
rise to the phenomenon of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117"
id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> the mirage, and which reach their
fullest development in great desert districts when the air is still.</p>

<p>Again, it has been pointed out that the causes which bring showers
and thunderstorms to an end include the chilling of the lower parts of
the ascending column by the descent of cold rain or hail from above.
We may also add the shading of the underlying ground by the cloud
itself, and the absorption of heat in the partial evaporation of some
of the rain during the lower part of its fall. In a desert district
the arising currents are so dry that even a very great ascent does
not often result in visible cloud; and when it does, the cloud is
produced at so great a height that the air is too rarefied to produce
anything much denser than thin alto-stratus, from which no falling
droplets could reach the earth. It seems, then, that there will be
no such automatic check on the growth of the circulating system,
and it will go on growing in volume and intensity indefinitely. As
a matter of fact, this is not the case. A different check does come
into operation, but not until the indraught and updraught have become
so powerful as to draw up the dust and sand and generate a sandstorm,
the weight and shade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118"
id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> which, in time, destroys the circulating
currents which uplifted them.</p>

<p>Since, however, condensation is a considerable factor in producing
instability, we should expect that such sandstorms would be rarer than
thunderstorms are in an equally hot but well-watered district, which
is the fact. Again, since rain and cloud are checks upon such systems,
we should expect the sandstorm systems to be larger and far loftier
than thunderstorms, and to consist of far more violent atmospheric
movements. This also is the case, and when we know that some of these
disturbances have the dimensions of a cyclonic storm, it is easy to
understand how the finest dust may be raised to vast altitudes, into
the great upper currents of the air, by which it may be borne hundreds
of miles before returning to the ground. It is thus that the dust of
the African deserts is carried across the Mediterranean to Europe, and
the yellow loess from Mongolia even to the eastward of Japan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="chtitle">WAVE CLOUDS</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Reference</span> has already
been made on more than one occasion to the remarkable rippled or wavy
structure sometimes assumed by clouds. The waves may be of almost any
dimensions, from the broad bands into which a sheet of cirro-stratus
or of alto-stratus is sometimes divided, down to the most minute
ripples. Sometimes they are ranged in long straight lines, sometimes
they are bent into sharp angles, and sometimes curved in very elaborate
patterns; but whether they be large or small, straight or curved, no
one can see them and fail to conclude that they must be due to an
action more or less analogous to the causes which produce waves on the
sea or ripple marks upon the sand.</p>

<p>Wave clouds occur at all heights where clouds are formed. The
break-up of a lifting fog into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120"
id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> roller clouds is probably the lowest
example, but it may more frequently be seen in higher clouds of the
alto or cirrus kinds.</p>

<p>A low example is given in Plate <a href="#Plate_40">40</a>, which represents stratus
maculosus, and which has already been described. A higher type is shown
in Plate <a href="#Plate_54">54</a>, which is a wave-like arrangement of alto-cumulus. Rather
higher come the long zig-zag bands of Plate <a href="#Plate_55">55</a>, in which the stratiform
arrangement is more obvious, and which would be best described as a
wave-form of alto-stratus. These two plates form striking contrasts.
The clouds shown in the first are distinctly of the cumulus order,
and a prominent feature is the way in which the right-hand side of
each wave has a clear-cut rounded contour like that of the upper edge
of a small cumulus, while the left-hand edge of each band is frayed
out into a ragged fringe. The whole cloud was moving slowly in a
direction nearly, but not quite, at right angles to the waves, and
the fringed edge formed the rear. It is evident that this peculiar
structure must be due to a series of narrow waves intersecting a plane
in which the air is just on the point of producing alto-cumulus. If
there were no such waves, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121"
id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> little uprising currents, with their
intervening down currents, would be irregularly distributed, and
all the wave disturbances have had to do is to arrange them. The
consequence is that as the waves pass along the stratum the air is
alternately raised and lowered. Where it is rising condensation takes
place, where it is falling evaporation results.</p>

</div>

<p>The cloud, like most other wave clouds, did not retain its
features for any length of time, but the gaps closed slowly in as
the cloud-bands increased in size, until a sheet of alto-stratus was
produced. Since the time of day was the morning, it is almost certain
that the plane of saturation was rising in accordance with the general
law, which is that the planes of condensation rise steadily, until
about two or three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, and then slowly
descend.</p>

<p>In Plate <a href="#Plate_55">55</a> each band is much flatter and less dense. They are
just as evidently formed by wave movements intersecting the plane of
condensation; but this was formed in the evening when the sun was
nearing the horizon, and at a time when the cloud planes are as a rule
rapidly descending.</p>

<p>Among the alto clouds wave-forms sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> persist for a fairly
long time, and in this case the bands moved steadily onward in a
direction equally inclined to their length and breadth, that is to
say, from the bottom left-hand corner of the photograph to the top
right-hand corner. As they passed across the sky new bands kept on
making their appearance at about the same spot, each band persisting
with little change until it had passed out of sight.</p>

<p>Going much higher up into the region of cirrus, we meet with the
most minute and delicate ripple clouds. Some of these have already
been referred to. They are connected with either cirro-macula,
cirro-cumulus, or cirro-stratus, just as the coarser textured waves we
have been considering are connected with alto-cumulus or alto-stratus.
In Plate <a href="#Plate_56">56</a> we have an example in which we can see the stages in
the process. Nearest to the zenith we have cirro-cumulus, which is
here and there irregularly distributed, but is generally arranged in
delicate ripples, which are variously curved. Nearer the horizon the
troughs of the waves are filled in, and sheets of cirro-stratus are the
result. Here, again, the wave-form is evidently not typical. It<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> is
an arrangement of either cirro-cumulus or cirro-stratus, produced by
the intersection of the plane of condensation by a series of wave
movements.</p>

<p><a id="Plate_56"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter screenonly" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p>The arrangement is, however, so striking a feature when it is well
shown that any description of the cloud which contains no reference to
the waves is manifestly incomplete, and this would be best effected
by adding the word undatus or waved to the name of the cloud. Plate
54 will then be alto-cumulus undatus, Plate <a href="#Plate_55">55</a> alto-stratus undatus,
and Plate <a href="#Plate_56">56</a> would be described as cirro-cumulus undatus, passing into
cirro-stratus undatus and cirro-stratus. In popular language Plate 55
might be called alto waves, Plate <a href="#Plate_54">54</a> crested alto waves, and Plate 56
cirro ripples.</p>

<p>If we are satisfied that the wave clouds are due to a wave movement
intersecting a plane of incipient cloud formation, the whole question
of their mode of production resolves itself into two parts&mdash;how is
that plane of incipient condensation produced? and how can we account
for the intersecting waves?</p>

<p>The first question has by far the greater importance, since
it amounts to asking for a general explanation of the production
of high clouds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124"
id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> especially the forms of cirro-cumulus,
cirro-stratus, cirro-macula, and the corresponding alto varieties.
There are, again, two divisions also to this question. How does the
water vapour reach the stratum in sufficient quantity to saturate it?
and when condensation takes place, why does it so frequently assume
the characteristic mottled and granular forms like crowds of little
cumulus clouds arranged in one level? This last sentence gives the
clue. They are, in truth, little cumulus clouds, and must be formed
in exactly the same way as their vastly larger prototypes of lower
regions. It has been explained that low cumulus is the result of large
upward moving air columns or convection currents, each one being
initially caused by the heating of the vapour-laden air near the
ground, and each uprising column being supplied by cooler descending
air which flows down in the intervening spaces. It has also been
explained that these movements result in changes of temperature, which
tend to check those movements and restore the original equilibrium.
Suppose this to occur, as it constantly does, without any column
reaching sufficiently high to produce a cloud. There will be no visible
effect, but, nevertheless, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125"
id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> important change has taken place. Every
ascending current has lifted some water vapour with it to a higher
level, and the descending drier air has come down in contact with
the ground or damper air to become equally charged with moisture in
its turn. The process will be repeated again and again, and at one
level after another, so that the water vapour travels ever higher and
higher.</p>

<p>This process of interchange between ascending and descending
air has been called by Mr. Ley inversion, but the term does not
seem very suitable, and interconvection would be better. The two
opposite currents pass through each other, as if the ascending air
gathered itself into definite channels, and passed through holes
in the descending mass like the passage of water upwards through a
descending plate of perforated metal. Moreover, just as the holes in
such a descending plate might have any size, so that the ascending
streams might vary in breadth from the finest hair to a column of huge
diameter, in exactly the same way the ascending columns of air may vary
from the smallest imaginable size to the great cumulo-nimbus currents.
It is the little currents which account for<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> the constant quiver of
the margins of any object which is viewed through a large telescope
by day, and for the haze, so characteristic of a hot day, which makes
distant objects seem ill-defined and in a state of continual tremble.
The rays of light in passing through the intersecting streams are bent
a little, now this way, now that, as the air currents sway to and
fro.</p>

<p>The near neighbourhood of the ground is not essential. As long
as the temperature of the air at any level is rising, so long
interconvection must occur. The process will be independent of the
presence or absence of wind. All that wind can do is to mix up the air
at different levels, breaking the system of currents and reducing it
to, so to say, a finer texture, or producing eddies, if strong enough,
which direct the currents and gather them into definite channels. The
final result in any case is that, with rising temperature, water vapour
is steadily borne upwards from the ground.</p>

<p>As it ascends the air becomes cooler, and yet retains its water
vapour. When the rising currents are large they mix little with the
descending dry air, and on reaching a certain level condensation<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
takes place, and we have the beginning of a cumulus. If they are of a
more moderate size they will ascend less rapidly, the admixture with
descending air will bear a larger proportion to the whole, and the
plane at which condensation will begin will be higher, and then each
small column will be tipped with a ball of alto-cumulus. Make the
interconvection currents smaller still, and the cloud plane will be
lifted yet higher, and we shall have cirro-cumulus or cirro-macula.</p>

<p>Now, the more even the distribution of temperature on the ground
the less the probability of coarse interconvection, and the same is
true of any higher stratum of air, provided it is free from disturbing
influences from outside. If, therefore, we have large currents near the
ground, ending, as they must, in cumulus, it has already been explained
that these clouds stop the action, and the general system of large
currents will be restricted to the region in which they occur. At some
distance above the lower clouds the only difference will be that water
vapour has been brought up to their level in great abundance. Smaller
systems of interconvection can then exist, and so we may have<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> the
spectacle of several layers of cloud&mdash;cumulus capping the great
currents of lower regions, alto-cumulus forming the summits of the
smaller currents of intermediate regions, and cirro-cumulus floating
far above both.</p>

<p>Frequently it happens that before the ascent of vapour has gone
quite far enough to produce a cloud, other causes co-operate, and
the cloud makes its appearance suddenly over considerable patches of
sky. The most potent of these is a fall of the barometric pressure,
which is brought about by some of the air far above the region of
even the highest clouds flowing away to some other district. The
air at all lower levels being thus relieved of the superincumbent
pressure, immediately expands, and is thereby cooled throughout.
Consequently, if at any level it was near its point of saturation,
it will be carried beyond that point, and cloud will rapidly make
its appearance over a large part of the sky, possibly at more
than one level. Stratiform arrangements will be the rule; but if
interconvection is going on at the time, its presence will be betrayed
by a granular or cumuloid structure. Interconvection clouds should
then be most frequent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129"
id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> best formed when the air as a whole
is still or moving slowly (so as not to create great eddies), when
the temperature is rising rapidly, and when the barometer is making a
sudden fall. All these conditions are met in thunder weather, and at
the time when a summer anticyclone is giving way. It will be remembered
that many of the most beautiful forms have been described as forming
under one or the other of these very conditions.</p>

<p>A second contributing cause, and one which tends to make the
condensation in patches or long broad bands ranged roughly at right
angles to the direction in which the air is moving, has been referred
to earlier. It is the passage of the air over an undulating country;
the up-and-down movements of the lower air being transmitted upwards
to great altitudes, as ever broadening and flattening waves. If the
upper air is flowing more rapidly than the lower, these broad waves may
be far ahead of their real cause, which will, therefore, quite escape
recognition, but the phenomenon is constantly to be detected in the
arrangement of the lower clouds. Two instances in the writer&#8217;s
experience will suffice. It was desired one morning to<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
measure the altitude of some small clouds which were passing from
the north-west at a height of probably between 2000 and 4000 metres,
over a hill only about 150 metres higher than the valley in which the
apparatus was fixed. In order to make the measurement, it was necessary
for the cloud to cross the valley and appear in the same field of view
as the sun, according to the method that will be described further
on. But in order to cross the valley the air had to descend, and so,
of course, had the cloud stratum, though to a less extent. But small
as the descent was, it was enough to dry up the clouds entirely, and
for more than a couple of hours the clouds came sailing over the
hill, disappearing entirely, and then reforming so far beyond that
no measurement was possible, since not one single fragment came near
enough to the position of the sun, which remained shining brightly
through a broad clear gap between two patches of cloud-strewn sky.</p>

<p>On another occasion considerable preparations had been made for
some photographic observations during an eclipse of the sun. The
observatory stands on the eastern side of the valley of the Exe,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> which
is flanked on its western side by a long ridge of hills going up to 800
feet above the sea. Beyond these hills lies the deep, narrow valley of
the Teign, and beyond that the granite ramparts of Dartmoor, 1000 feet
above the sea. The wind was blowing gently across the two valleys, and
shortly before the eclipse began a broad strip of thin cloud formed
above and rather towards the eastern side of the Exe valley, just where
the sun was, while at the same time the sky was practically clear half
a mile further east, and bright sunlight was streaming down on the
ridge between the two rivers a few miles towards the west. The cloud
was never thick enough to quite hide the sun, so that the eclipse was
easy to watch with the naked eye; but in spite of fairly rapid movement
of the cloud masses as they drifted before the sun, they kept on
forming in just the same place, and completely prevented the carrying
out of the programme planned. It is almost certain that the phenomenon
was brought about by an upward moving wave marking the place where the
level of approaching saturation was upheaved by the disturbance caused
by crossing the two valleys and intervening ridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132"
id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>These two instances are not quoted as examples of a rare occurrence,
but as definite simple instances of a phenomenon which may be
constantly observed, and as proof that the conformation of the ground
does exercise an influence upon the distribution of cloud.</p>

<p>But no irregularities of the ground will suffice to explain the
minute waves and ripples which have been described at the beginning
of this chapter. These must be due to wave disturbances in the air
itself. They have been explained as due to two different currents of
air, either a warm damp current flowing over a cold one, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice
vers&acirc;</i>. Now, such an occurrence as a warm damp current flowing
over a cold one must be very rare, though it is impossible to deny that
it might occur. The immediate contact of a cold current above a warm
damp one is equally unlikely, unless the general atmospheric condition
were greatly disturbed, which is the same thing as saying that wave
clouds would not occur. They are most frequent at just those times
when interconvection has freest play, and this is amply sufficient
to account for a plane of saturation without any necessity for a
hypothesis of two layers of air at different temperatures all<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> but
producing cloud at their junction. No convincing evidence of cloud
production by such means has yet been adduced, and it is better to rely
upon causes which we know do operate than to call in theories as to
what might possibly happen. This is one of those points in the study of
clouds which need investigation, and until proof is forthcoming it is
better to say that the admixture of two strata of air might conceivably
produce cloud, but most forms can be accounted for by other causes of
which we have more positive evidence.</p>

<p>Still, the wave clouds are due to waves, and there seems no other
way of accounting for them than the supposition of gentle differential
currents. But if such currents occur the ripples and waves will not
be limited to a definite surface, so to say, of contact, but will be
propagated upwards and downwards for considerable distances from the
level of greatest disturbance. Whether, therefore, the level at which
the natural operation of interconvection has produced saturation is
high or low in this region, the result will be the marshalling of the
ascending and descending elements of the convection system in the
characteristic waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134"
id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The differential currents, then, which cause the waves must not be
conceived as producing those waves at a surface of contact, nor must
the currents be thought of as separated by any definite surface, but
rather by a region of variable but usually considerable depth, in which
the air is disturbed by a series of small slow eddies and oscillatory
movements. When the waves are parallel straight lines the air currents
may be really portions of a whole, having the upper part more rapid
than the lower. In such a case the direction of movement should be
at right angles to the cloud lines. If the upper current differs in
direction as well as velocity, the direction of movement of the clouds
will be intermediate, and will resemble that of the upper or lower
current, according to their relative distances from the plane at which
the clouds are formed.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the clouds will depend upon the relative shares
in their production borne by interconvection pure and simple and by
the wave oscillations. If the stratum is one in which cloud would
actually be formed independently of the up-and-down movements, all
this will be able to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135"
id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> will be to arrange the cloudlets at
their birth, and these will then continue to exist, drifting with the
general horizontal movement of the air like any other cloud of the same
order.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the production of cloud is dependent upon the
vertical oscillations, the cloudlets or lines of cloud will move with
the air waves, and their rate of motion and direction of motion will
be determined by the rate and direction of the waves, which may be
quite different from that of the air at that stratum as a whole. The
ascending waves will be marked by lines of cloud generally rounder and
better defined on their advancing sides, while the descending troughs
will be marked by clear intervals.</p>

<p>Wave movements of the necessary kind are frequently very
complicated, and it is not by any means a rare occurrence to see the
wave lines in one part of the sky at all sorts of angles with similar
lines in other parts, or even to see two or more sets of waves at
different altitudes crossing one another. Either phenomenon is always
accompanied by rapid changes in the cloud, and the rippled structure is
short-lived. This was the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136"
id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> with the clouds shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_54">54</a>.
Plate <a href="#Plate_53">53</a>, on the contrary, shows great uniformity in the wave lines,
and although the vertical oscillation is probably the main cause of
condensation, the form was unusually persistent.</p>

<p>Irregular patches of wave disturbance, affecting a plane occupied by
cirro-stratus vittatus, are shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_57">57</a>. In this case the wave
systems only touch the cloud plane here and there, and the places of
contact varied rapidly. It is pretty clear from this photograph that
the idea of the waves being formed at a surface of contact between two
diverse currents will not suffice. The bands of the cirro-stratus are
for the most part unbroken and unaffected; it is only here and there
that the wave region touches them.</p>

<p>The conclusions at which we have arrived are simple, and there is
little room for doubt as to their main correctness, but there are
numerous minute features presented by these beautiful cloud patterns
which await interpretation, and they reveal complicated oscillatory
movements in the air which are difficult to account for, whether we
seek their originating causes or the mechanics of their motions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="chtitle">CLOUD ALTITUDES</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">During</span> an extended
experience of cloud photography, it was found that it was quite
possible to get pictures which showed the cloud detail even when
the sun was in the field of view. Sometimes the solar image was
reversed, but if the exposure was very short this was not the case.
In such photographs the structure of the cloud was exceedingly clear
and sharply defined quite close to the sun. Indeed, the intense
illumination seemed to reveal minute details of internal arrangement
which could not be detected in similar clouds some distance away.</p>

<p>The methods which had been employed for the measurement of cloud
altitudes elsewhere have already been briefly referred to. Some of
them required two observers, who were equally responsible, each of
them having to direct his apparatus or camera to the same point of
the cloud, and to record<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138"
id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> the exact direction in which the
instrument was pointed. The instruments, if accurate, were costly,
and there were many opportunities for error in reading the graduated
circles which gave the directions. Moreover, in most of these methods
the two observers were connected by telephone, and had to agree on
the exact point towards which their instruments should be directed;
either the exact point of the cloud, or the precise direction as shown
by the mounting of the camera or other instrument. At Kew some of
these sources of error were avoided by fixing the two cameras with the
axes of the lenses and centres of the plates in a vertical position
and exposing the two plates simultaneously. The Kew observations
were not long continued, and for some years the only measurements in
progress were those carried out abroad, particularly at the Blue Hill
Observatory and at Upsala.</p>

<p>The experience gained in photographing clouds in order to record
their forms suggested a way in which many of the sources of error in
previous measurements of altitude could be avoided, especially by
simplifying and reducing the operations at the moment of making the
observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139"
id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>If two cameras are placed at the opposite ends of a measured base
line, whose direction is known, and if they are both pointed towards
the sun, on making the exposures by electrical means at the same
moment, the position of the image of the sun upon the plate gives the
direction in which the cameras are pointed. It will be in the same
direction as seen from both ends of the line.</p>

<p>Now, if we note the time at which the exposure is made, this with
the date gives all that is required for ascertaining the sun&#8217;s
position in the sky, and is, therefore, the only exact observation
which need be made at the time of taking the photographs. Mistakes
are almost impossible, as each plate contains its own record of the
sun&#8217;s position, and even if some of the plates should get mixed
the images of the clouds will generally suffice to pair them properly.
For general measurements there is one grave defect in the method, and
that is that it can only be used when the sun and cloud can be got into
the same field of view. But with the higher varieties of cloud this
is generally possible, and it was just these higher sorts about which
knowledge was least certain, and which it was proposed to study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140"

<p>An initial difficulty was the finding of a level site, flat land
being very uncommon in Devonshire, but fortunately a suitable place was
found in some artificially levelled ground close to Exeter, belonging
to the London and South Western Railway Company. It was a stretch of
ground intended to be covered with sidings, but had not been finished,
and had become overgrown with grass, stunted sallows, and other wild
plants. Being railway ground, it was, comparatively, though by no means
entirely, free from mischievous and inquisitive people. The next point
was a suitable camera. It must have fairly long focus in order to give
a large image, and therefore large displacement; it must be capable
of being pointed in any direction and clamped there; and it must be
capable of standing considerable extremes of temperature and variations
of dampness, as it was intended that they should be kept on the spot in
wooden structures, which served for stands as well as to contain the
apparatus.</p>

<p>The pattern finally decided upon is represented in Plate 58, which
shows one of the cameras pointed up to the sky and standing on one of
the stands. These cameras were to take plates of whole plate<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
size, two double dark slides of the ordinary pattern being attached to
each.</p>

<p>CAMERA FOR MEASURING ALTITUDES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The camera looks rather complicated, but it is really simple. Its
body consists of front and back, each attached to a central part by a
short bellows and sliding on a base board, to which it can be clamped
by screws of the usual pattern. The central part carries trunnions,
such as are used for looking-glasses, which swing in sockets carried
by two upright supports, so as to give the whole free motion in a
vertical plane. In order to be able to fix it firmly at any angle, the
base board of the camera body carries on its underside a thin board
projecting beneath it and forming a segment of a circle whose centre
would be the horizontal axis through the trunnions. The board passes
between the jaws of a small wooden clamping vice in front, which is
carried by the square base to which the uprights are fixed. The whole
is firmly made of well-seasoned pine, and has stood well the hard usage
of half a dozen years.</p>

<p>There is no focusing screen. Focusing was done with great care
once for all, and then a coat of hard varnish was put over all
the adjusting screws.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142"
id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> A small view-finder is attached to one
side, and it was by this that the camera was pointed in the desired
direction.</p>

<p>In order to lessen risk of mistake, it was so arranged that the two
slides belonging to one camera would not fit the other. The lenses,
of 18 inches focus, and giving sharp detail all over the plate, were
carefully matched, and the focus adjusted until the images given by
them when placed side by side appeared to coincide exactly. They were
provided with iris diaphragms, which were shut down to an aperture of
a quarter of an inch, and with shutters which could be released at the
same moment by an electric current, acting through the electro-magnet
shown under the lens on the front of the camera.</p>

<p>The shutters were of the kind known as the &#8220;Chronolux,&#8221;
which will give any exposure from the sixty-fourth of a second up to
three seconds. But it was found in practice that the highest speed was
sufficient and gave satisfactory results. Of course, there was no idea
of adjusting matters on each occasion so as to get the best possible
negatives capable of yielding good prints. Measurement was the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
object, and if the negative showed the sun and sufficient cloud detail
for the identification of cloud points, that was all that was wanted.
The shutters gave a good deal of trouble at first. Their sliding parts
were made of ebonite, and when the cameras were left in their stands
with an August sun shining down upon them, everything inside got
very hot and the ebonite warped; but the difficulty was got over by
substituting aluminium.</p>

<p>The two camera stands were placed 200 yards apart, and were
connected by a line of telegraph wire carried on short poles. At each
end of the wire an insulated connecting piece was brought down to the
camera stand, and to the batteries and other apparatus. The current
which was sent through this wire by pressing a contact at one end of
the line did not directly make the exposures; but two similar relays
were brought into action, and each of these sent the current from a
local battery of Leclanch&eacute; cells through the electro-magnet on
the camera and made the exposure.</p>

<p>After development the two negatives showed the image of the
sun, not far from the centre of the field of view, and the cloud
whose altitude was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144"
id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> required. Since this was taken from
two different points of view, the negatives were not alike, but the
distances between the centre of the sun&#8217;s disc and any special
point of the cloud were different. For instance, if the cloud were east
of the sun, with its edge just apparently touching the solar image as
photographed from the eastern station, then the negative taken from the
western end of the base would show an interval of clear sky between the
two, which would be greater as the cloud was lower.</p>

<p>It often happened that after developing the plates the image
of the sun was lost in a black blur, but it was easy to reduce
this part of the image by local application of a reducing agent<a
name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by means of a paint-brush, until the disc
became clear enough. Two lines were then drawn on the negative,
one vertical and the other horizontal, intersecting each other at
the centre of the sun&#8217;s image. These lines served as the
starting-points for exactly measuring the distance from their point of
intersection to any selected point of the cloud.</p>

<p>The distances could generally be determined to<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> a
fiftieth or a hundredth part of an inch, and their difference was,
of course, dependent upon the direction of the sun relative to the
base line and the altitude of the cloud, but for low level clouds the
difference was sometimes so great that no pair of corresponding points
could be detected, while it was often as much as an inch. With higher
clouds the differences were smaller, but unless the sun was very low in
the sky, either east or west, the displacements of the cloud image were
great enough to give reliable measures. Specimen prints from pairs of
negatives are shown in Plates 59 and 60.</p>

<p>The processes by which the measurements are worked out are
laborious,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a
href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and consist
of two parts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146"
id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> the first being the determination of
the exact position of the sun from the date, hour, and latitude and
longitude of the place, and the second, the determination of the
position of the cloud. Two points which represent the same part of the
cloud are selected, and their respective distances from the two lines
drawn through the sun are measured as accurately as possible. Now, a
certain distance on the negative corresponds with a definite angular
displacement, and a scale can be constructed showing how much should be
added to or subtracted from the sun&#8217;s position to get the exact
position of the cloud. This being done, it is then a simple piece of
trigonometry to deduce the actual height of<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> the cloud above the
place of observation. The work of computation, however, was greatly
lightened by the fact that many of the pairs of negatives showed more
than one layer of cloud; thus Plate <a href="#Plate_59">59</a>, which is a fair specimen, shows
three layers, and, consequently, one determination of the sun&#8217;s
position sufficed for three distinct results.</p>

<p>For the highest clouds the displacements were, of course, small,
and could only be made with certainty of a correct result within about
three hours of noon. Earlier than 9 a.m., or later than 3 p.m., the
sun was too nearly in a line with the two stations, or too low in the
sky, to give a sufficient displacement of image. A base line of 400
yards instead of 200 would have been better for the high clouds. But,
on the other hand, when low level clouds are viewed from two different
spots their outlines may seem so changed that it may be impossible to
identify a pair of corresponding points, and the same difficulty may
also arise when high clouds are seen through a gap in a lower stratum.
The longer the base line the more frequent and more obtrusive would
this perspective difficulty become, so the distance of 200 yards<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
between the stations was adopted as a convenient mean.</p>

<p>The method of making the observations was simple. Each observer was
provided with some signal flags, by which the necessary communications
were made in accordance with a simple code. Call the two observers A
and B, and suppose A directed the operations. He watched the sky until
a favourable opportunity seemed to be approaching. He then signalled
to B, and both cameras were turned to the sun, the dark slides were
inserted, the shutters set, and everything made ready. Signals were
then interchanged, to signify that preparations were complete, and when
A saw that the edge of the cloud had reached a suitable position to be
in the same field of view with the sun, the contact key was pressed and
the plates simultaneously exposed. At the moment when this was done the
time was noted. Several observations were thus made in a short time.</p>

<p>Measurements were carried out as opportunity allowed over
four consecutive seasons, from the beginning of April until
the end of October. During the last of the four years, the
site had become less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149"
id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> convenient owing to an extension of the
railway work, and early in November the series was brought to an abrupt
conclusion by a heavy gale, which snapped off all the poles carrying
the connecting wire. But by that time 423 measurements had been
obtained, the great majority of which referred to clouds of the cirrus
and alto groups.</p>

<p>The general results may be tabulated thus, giving heights in
metres:&mdash;</p>

<p>These values are not very different, on the whole, from those
which have been arrived at elsewhere, and in making a comparison it
must be borne in mind that there is always a little want of precision
in cloud nomenclature. As a whole, the Exeter maxima are greater
than the foreign ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150"
id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> and this is very markedly so in the
case of cirrus, for which the American highest record is 14,930
metres, the Swedish record is 13,376, while the Exeter value is 27,413
metres, or about 17 miles. But this extreme measurement, and several
others unusually large, were made in one morning, a day of very hot
damp weather, when cloud formed at seven different levels: cumulus
at a height of 1&middot;9 miles, alto-cumulus at 3&middot;9 miles,
cirro-cumulus at 4&middot;7 miles, cirro-stratus (No. 1) at 8 miles,
cirro-stratus (No. 2) at 9&middot;6 miles, cirrus at 11&middot;5
miles, and cirrus excelsus at 17 miles. By about half-past one in the
afternoon the sky was completely overcast with dull grey clouds, which
cleared off at half-past four, and at half-past five in the evening
the cirrus had fallen to 7&middot;9 miles, and the cirro-cumulus
to 4&middot;3 miles. If this one day&#8217;s observations had been
omitted, the Exeter maximum would only have been little more than 1000
metres above the record from across the Atlantic, but 1000 metres is a
height worth noting.</p>

<p>While the Exeter maxima are all rather greater, we find the minima
for cirrus, cirro-stratus, and cirro-cumulus are rather less than at
the foreign stations; that is to say, that clouds are formed over<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Devonshire both at lower and at higher levels than seems to be the case
in Massachusetts or Sweden. It seems probable that this is due to a
greater humidity on our western coasts, such as we should suppose would
be the case from their position and the prevailing winds and ocean
currents. If so, we should expect the great convection clouds to be
larger. Thus, at Exeter, out of only fifteen examples of cumulo-nimbus,
the top varied from 2004 metres to 6409, with an average base level
of 1045. At Upsala the maximum was 5970 and the minimum 1400, with an
average base level of 1400. The mean thickness of the Swedish clouds
was only 1400 metres, while that of the Devonshire specimens was more
than 2000 metres.</p>

<p>Again and again, during the progress of these measurements, it was
found that the greatest altitudes and the richest development of the
higher varieties occurred towards the end of a spell of fine calm
weather, when convection had had free play day after day. A slight
fall of the barometer, only the hundredth part of an inch, would
usually, under those circumstances, bring about abundant formation of
high clouds, frequently of the undatus kind.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> All the cumulus
clouds, by which we mean to include alto-cumulus and cirro-cumulus,
are most frequent when the levels of condensation are rising, while
the stratiform clouds are an indication of no vertical movement or
of active descent. Pure cirrus is indicative rather of movement in a
horizontal direction, and may occur when the condensation levels are
stationary, or when they are rapidly changing either way.</p>

<p>In broken weather the natural movements of the atmosphere and of
its vapour are masked and disturbed by the strong eddies brought by
the cyclonic systems. It not unfrequently happens that the region of
disturbance does not reach up to the level of the highest cirrus, or,
what is more probable, the cyclonic system leans so far forward that we
may have in its rear the upper clouds floating quietly far above the
comparatively shallow region of disturbance, while in front the upper
part of the storm system projects above undisturbed air.</p>

<p>The frequent appearance of cloud almost at the same time at more
than one level is at first rather difficult to understand, but it will
be noticed that when this occurs the barometer almost invariably<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
falls. Now, if we suppose that the air is nearly saturated at more than
one level, and that the whole is then bodily relieved of some of the
superincumbent mass, so that the barometer falls, the mass of air will
at once swell up, being cooled from top to bottom simultaneously, and
wherever it is damp enough cloud will be formed.</p>

<p>The converse is equally true. If we have cloud at several levels,
and the whole is compressed by the addition of more air above, which is
the case when the barometer rises, that compression will be accompanied
by the generation of heat and the consequent disintegration and
disappearance of the clouds.</p>

<p>During our survey of these groups we have found that some of them
include clouds of many shapes, which must be due to very diverse
conditions. It follows that if observations are to be made on the
occurrence of these special kinds, with a view to arriving at a
thorough understanding of the circumstances to which they owe their
forms, it becomes necessary to devise a code of names and symbols
whereby an interchange of ideas and records may be rendered possible.
Specific names have been proposed as each form was considered, and
it only remains to sum them up concisely. Subsequent observation,
particularly in other climates, may show that further additions should
be made; but if the principle of specific names be once admitted, it
will be easy to fill any omission.</p>

<p>2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cirro-filum</i> (Ley) (Plate <a href="#Plate_7">7</a>). Thread cirrus.</p>

<p>Built up of fine long threads, straight, curved, or crossing, but
free from hazy curling or flocculent structures. Ci. F.</p>

<p>3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cirrus excelsus</i> (Plate <a href="#Plate_5">5</a>). High cirrus.</p>

<p>Characterized by great altitude, thinness, irregular branching
structure. Ci. Ex.</p>

<p>4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cirrus ventosus</i> (Plate <a href="#Plate_6">6</a>). Windy cirrus.</p>

<p>Characterized by curving branches leaning forward in the direction
of movement, and other long curving streamers lagging behind and below.
Fluffy parts are usually present, and mark the origins of the long
curling fibres. Ci. V.</p>

<p>5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cirrus nebulosus</i> (Plate <a href="#Plate_9">9</a>). Hazy cirrus.</p>

<p>Characterized by the absence of sharply defined lines, fibres, or

<p>In its most typical state, stratus consists of a sheet of cloud
of approximately uniform thickness. The most common form, however,
does vary considerably, though usually dense enough to hide the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> sun.

cirrifying at its edges.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">General Terms</span></h3>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nimbus</i>, a term applied to a cloud from which rain is falling. When
the form of the cloud is visible, the term should be attached to that
belonging to the cloud. It may, however, be used as a substantive alone
when there is nothing to show from what sort of cloud, or combination
of clouds, the rain is falling (Plates <a href="#Plate_35">35</a> and <a href="#Plate_36">36</a>).</p>

<p>Nimbus is either heavy stratus, massive strato-cumulus,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> or a
combination of these with stratiform clouds above, and possibly ragged
masses of fracto-cumulus below. N. either alone or after the sign of
the cloud.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fracto-</i> is a term placed as a prefix before the name of a cloud to
indicate that the cloud has ragged irregular margins, as if it had been
more or less torn to pieces. It is sometimes less awkward to append the
word fractus after the name of the cloud.</p>

<p>A convenient abbreviation would be to write F. after the name of the
cloud.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Undatus</i>, or waved, should always be added to the name of any cloud
which shows the arrangement so described.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="chtitle">CLOUD PHOTOGRAPHY</span></h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Reference</span> has been
made in the first chapter to the fact that those who wish to make a
photographic study of clouds must follow a special course of procedure.
For every photographic purpose there is some particular process or some
special kind of apparatus which is better fitted for the end in view
than any other, and half the difficulty in attaining success is to find
out the best tools and the best methods.</p>

<p>There is no difficulty whatever in securing excellent photographs
of heavy grey clouds, or of clouds which stand out dark against
a twilight sky. Any camera and any plate can be used, and in an
experienced hand will ensure success after a few trials, but except
under these special conditions, cirrus, in all its varieties, the
alto clouds, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166"
id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> many of the lower ones, present a real
difficulty due to two causes. In the first place, they and their
surroundings are so brilliant that a very short exposure is sufficient,
far shorter than would be needed for a sunlit landscape; and in the
second place, the actinic value of the light they reflect is very
little greater than that received from the background of blue sky. When
so minute a difference comes to be represented in the monochrome of the
ordinary photograph, the eye fails to appreciate it, and all the finer
details are lost.</p>

<p>Now, if proper care is taken in the development of a negative,
satisfactory results may be attained even if the exposure is twice as
great, or only half as great, as it should have been to get the best
result. But if the exposure is four or more times the best duration,
the negative will generally yield but poor contrasts, if any result
at all can be coaxed out. Again, if the exposure is only a quarter or
less of the ideal time, little or no image will come out. Suppose,
now, we have a brilliant object, and the correct exposure for the
plate and aperture of lens employed should be one-fiftieth of a
second; if we make an error either in judging or in effecting<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> the
exposure, which amounts to one twenty-fifth of a second too much, we
get the negative exposed three times as much as it should be. Suppose,
again, the object is less brilliant, and the correct exposure should
be one-fifth of a second, an equal error of one twenty-fifth will
make little difference. But in photographing cirrus and such clouds,
if we used the same plates and the same lens apertures as we employ
for ordinary landscape work, we should want exposures of the order of
those given by a focal plane shutter, and a mistake either in judging
or in making the exposure, of even the hundredth part of a second,
would be fatal to good results, and would probably completely spoil the
plate. Evidently one of our first steps must be to lengthen the correct
exposure.</p>

<p>There are four ways in which this can be done&mdash;by using a
slow-acting plate, by lessening the aperture of the lens, by putting
some transparent screen in front of the lens to shut off some of the
light, and, finally, by pointing the camera, not at the cloud itself,
but at its image in a black mirror.</p>

<p>Of these, of course the slow plate and small aperture are the
simplest to adopt, and all the cloud<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> studies shown in the
illustrations to these pages have been taken on plates prepared
for photo-mechanical purposes or for transparencies. There seems
to be nothing to choose between these two brands. Orthochromatic,
isochromatic, double-coated, and many other special types of plate
had previously been tried, both with coloured filters in front of the
lens and without them, without showing any marked superiority over an
ordinary plate of low rapidity. At last the photo-mechanical plates
were tried, and the efforts made to get satisfactory cloud portraits,
which had previously been marked only now and then with satisfactory
results, became uniformly and continuously successful.</p>

<p>If the slow plates are exposed in the camera without either a
screen or the black mirror, the diaphragm should be reduced to a small
size and the exposure suitably adjusted. The length of exposure may
generally be judged by looking at the image on the focusing screen, and
reducing the aperture until the picture shows its detail easily. Then,
regarding the picture as that of a sunlit sea or distant landscape,
judge the necessary exposure by the brightness of the image.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169"
id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>No definite rule can be given. The light varies enormously from day
to day, and hour to hour, and especially with the position occupied by
the cloud relative to the sun. Thus, working with a lens of six inches
focus and an aperture of a quarter of an inch, the exposure may vary
from the quickest snap of a Thornton-Pickard roller blind to as much as
a quarter of a second, or even more. Again, using a lens of eighteen
inches focus and an exposure of a fiftieth of a second, the necessary
aperture might vary from an eighth of an inch up to an inch and a
half. But if we suppose that we are dealing with an ordinary bright
summer sky between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and that the clouds are cirrus
or cirro-cumulus, an aperture of about one thirty-second of the focal
length will probably give some sort of image with a snap-shot exposure.
At first the failures will be many, but a little practice will soon
enable very respectable pictures to be taken by varying either the
diaphragm or the speed of shutter. Heavier clouds of the alto types
will need rather longer exposure or larger aperture.</p>

<p>The lens may be of any kind, as long as it gives a well-defined
image, but there are many advantages<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> in using one of the
rectilinear type provided with an iris diaphragm. A rapid lens is not
needed; indeed, it has been pointed out that slowness is a very great
desideratum, and if the camera is provided with a rapid lens it must
be ruthlessly stopped down. For general cloud purposes the best kind
of lens is a wide-angle rectilinear, but many occasions will present
themselves on which a lens of longer focus will be wanted in order to
give more insight into the details of some specially delicate clouds.
If the lenses are good, and the focusing is accurate, enlargements will
go a long way towards revealing the minuter structures, but the results
can never be quite so well defined as a direct photograph in a long
camera.</p>

<p>A shutter will be essential, and it should be one which opens in
the middle, or which travels across the lens. The shutters which are
ingeniously contrived to give more exposure to the lower part of the
picture than to its upper part are useless for the purpose in view. It
should have some latitude of exposure, from about one-sixtieth of a
second up to a full second or more.</p>

<p>Then as to the camera. Any light-tight camera<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> will
do, and, as the objects will all be at a great distance, it may very
well be a fixed-focus one, or may be kept set up and fixed in focus for
a distant object. If not, on setting it up it should be focused on the
horizon or most distant object possible, and not on the cloud itself.
As, however, the clouds present themselves at all heights above the
horizon, even in the zenith, it becomes necessary to have some means
of pointing the camera in such directions. To a certain extent the
ordinary stand does allow of tilting, but a special support which will
allow the camera to be fixed firmly in any position is of the greatest
convenience.</p>

<p>If the study is meant to be at all prolonged, the best plan is
to make a suitable camera, once for all, which can be left in fixed
focus, so as to be always ready, and which can be directed with equal
ease to any part of the sky, from the horizon to the zenith. If it is
intended to use a black mirror, then a special mount becomes almost
essential.</p>

<p>Many of the most delicate of the photographs reproduced here have
been taken with a camera of peculiar pattern, the structure of which
is shown in Plate <a href="#Plate_61">61</a>. The lens is an ordinary rapid rectilinear,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> and
the stop used was generally one-sixteenth of the focal length. The
shutter is a light slip of aluminium, which can be drawn across from
side to side at any desired pace. The body of the camera is mahogany,
with a bellows part for getting correct focus, but when once this was
obtained the back was clamped to the tail-board and a little varnish
brushed over the clamping screws.</p>

</div>

<p>The camera swings on a couple of screws, which act as trunnions.
These pass through two upright arms, which spring on either side from
the base board, which is attached to the ordinary camera stand. This
base board can be rotated into any horizontal position desired, and the
camera can be tilted through any vertical angle by swinging it between
the uprights, and can be clamped by tightening the two trunnion screws.
These screws are so placed on the front of the camera that the lens and
its attachments on the one side nearly balance the back part of the
camera on the other side, and so lessen the danger of slipping.</p>

<p>Supported in front of the lens by light brass-work is the
black mirror, made of a very dark glass optically worked on the
front face. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173"
id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> curious fact that, although bits of
plate-glass blackened on the back seem to the naked eye to give a
single image of sufficient truth, if such a mirror is placed in front
of the camera the second faint image formed by reflection from the
blackened surface is almost always to be detected. Moreover, the lens
with its large aperture at once detects irregularities in the surface
of the glass, which are quite imperceptible through the narrow limits
of the pupil. Black glass, with a truly worked surface, is essential
then, but the surface need not be of the high order of excellence
required for mirrors used for telescopic work, since the first image is
not, as a rule, intended to be highly magnified.</p>

<p>The mirror is held so that its surface makes an angle of about 33
degrees with the axis of the lens, and the block carrying shutter and
mirror can be turned round into any position by slipping it round the
lens mount as an axis. The mirror thus always retains the correct
angle.</p>

<p>The action of the mirror is to a large extent due to mere diminution
of brightness, but it also partly extinguishes the blue light of the
sky without exerting any such influence on the white light from<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> a
cloud. This is due to the fact that the blue light of the sky is partly
polarized, while that reflected from the cloud is not. Now, polarized
light which falls upon a black mirror held in a particular position is
not reflected by it. This position depends upon various circumstances,
but one condition is that the reflected ray must make an angle of about
33 degrees with the surface of the glass. The amount of the polarized
component of the blue light varies greatly, but is at a maximum at all
points 90 degrees away from the sun. This, then, is the best possible
position for photographing a cloud, as the whole of this polarized
component may be suppressed by adjusting the mirror to the proper
position, and then the most delicate cirrus fibres stand out brilliant
on an almost black background.</p>

<p>The black mirror could with some advantage be replaced by a
Nicol&#8217;s prism mounted between the components of the lens, so
that it could be turned in any position; but Nicol&#8217;s prisms
are expensive, and such an arrangement would cost many times the sum
sufficient for an excellent mirror, and then would narrow down the
field of view in a very inconvenient way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175"
id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>With this apparatus exposures of a tenth to a fifth of a second
were usually required for high clouds in bright daylight, while longer
times, up to a second, might be required under less actively actinic
conditions.</p>

<p>The exposure having been made, the next step is development.</p>

<p>Now, every practical photographer has his own pet formula, his own
particular favourite among the numerous developing compounds now on the
market. It is, therefore, rather a thankless task to offer advice as
to which should be selected. In all probability as good results may be
got by other methods and other formul&aelig;, and the description which
follows must be understood rather as an account of the process actually
adopted, than advice as to that which should be chosen.</p>

<p>The developer used has been always pyro and ammonia, made up in

a few seconds add more of the pyro solution, but unless the exposure
has been much overdone this will not happen. If the image begins to
appear after from thirty to forty seconds it is probable that the best
result will be reached by leaving it alone, but if there is any hanging
back of the detail another quarter bulk of ammonia should be put into
the glass, the developer mixed with it, and the whole returned to the
developing dish.</p>

<p>If no image appears after about forty seconds, add more ammonia as
above described, and leave for another forty seconds, and so on, until
by this method of trial the right quantity of alkali for the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
particular exposure has been ascertained. The development must never be
hurried, or the background of sky will blacken too soon, and in some
cases it may take a quarter of an hour or more to get enough density on
the cloud. But as a general rule the image is fully out in about two
minutes, and the plate is then washed and fixed in the usual way.</p>

<p>If a black mirror is used there will seldom be any necessity for
intensification, but if not, it may frequently be required, especially
for the more delicate kinds of cirrus. Indeed, the image may sometimes
be so thin that the common process of intensification by mercury and
ammonia does not give density enough. If that seems at all likely to be
the case, it is wiser to use the formula known as Monckhoven&#8217;s,
since that simply adds silver to silver instead of replacing the silver
image by some other body, and the process can consequently be repeated
more than once, if sufficient density is not secured by the first
application. The formula does not seem to be very often used, so it may
be best to quote it.</p>

<p>Place the washed negative in A until it has gone white, then rinse
it well and transfer to B, in which the image turns to a velvety black.
After washing, the process can be repeated.</p>

<p>Intensification is, however, only a way of saving photographs which
cannot be secured again. If the first photograph of a particular
variety of cloud is not satisfactory, it ought at least to tell the
operator where he had gone wrong, and a second attempt should produce
a better result than any image built up by chemical action on an
imperfect base.</p>

<p>There is nothing novel in any of these methods, and there is
no doubt that other formul&aelig; would be as good; but the one
thing essential is to have a developer whose action can be held
under control, and to apply that developer in such a way that very
considerable over-exposure will not result in the ruin of the plate. If
a number of photographs have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179"
id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> been taken in about the same part of
the sky, and within a short time of each other, then the correct
proportions of developer and alkali will be nearly the same for all,
but the first of such a batch will always have to be attacked in the
cautious step-by-step method. Patience and perseverance, backed by a
steady refusal to be discouraged by the failures which are at first
inevitable, are as certain to be crowned by success as they are in
other studies.</p>

<p>The workers are few, and there is much to be done; for it is mainly
to those who will photograph the higher clouds, and so trace the stages
of their growth and decay, that we must look for the data which will
enable us to solve the problems they present, and so enlarge the narrow
boundaries of our knowledge of some of the most beautiful things in
Nature.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
